CHAPTER I 
INTERNATIONAL APPLICATION AND INTERNATIONAL SEARCH 
Article 3 
The International Application 
 
(1)  Applications for the protection of inventions in any of the Contracting 
States may be filed as international applications under this Treaty. 
 
(2)  An international application shall contain, as specified in this Treaty and 
the Regulations, a request, a description, one or more claims, one or more 
drawings (where required), and an abstract. 
 
(3)  The abstract merely serves the purpose of technical information and 
cannot be taken into account for any other purpose, particularly not for the 
purpose of interpreting the scope of the protection sought. 
 
(4)  The international application shall: 
 
(i) be in a prescribed language; 
 
(ii) comply with the prescribed physical requirements; 
 
(iii) comply with the prescribed requirement of unity of invention; 
 
(iv) be subject to the payment of the prescribed fees. 
Article 4 
The Request 
 
(1)  The request shall contain: 
 
(i) a petition to the effect that the international application be processed 
according to this Treaty; 
 
(ii) the designation of the Contracting State or States in which protection 
for the invention is desired on the basis of the international application 
(“designated States”);  if for any designated State a regional patent is available 
and the applicant wishes to obtain a regional patent rather than a national 
patent, the request shall so indicate;  if, under a treaty concerning a regional 
patent, the applicant cannot limit his application to certain of the States party to 
that treaty, designation of one of those States and the indication of the wish to 
obtain the regional patent shall be treated as designation of all the States party 
to that treaty;  if, under the national law of the designated State, the designation 
of that State has the effect of an application for a regional patent, the 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
10 
designation of the said State shall be treated as an indication of the wish to 
obtain the regional patent; 
 
(iii) the name of and other prescribed data concerning the applicant and 
the agent (if any); 
 
(iv) the title of the invention; 
 
(v) the name of and other prescribed data concerning the inventor where 
the national law of at least one of the designated States requires that these 
indications be furnished at the time of filing a national application.  Otherwise, 
the said indications may be furnished either in the request or in separate notices 
addressed to each designated Office whose national law requires the furnishing 
of the said indications but allows that they be furnished at a time later than that 
of the filing of a national application. 
 
(2)  Every designation shall be subject to the payment of the prescribed fee 
within the prescribed time limit. 
 
(3)  Unless the applicant asks for any of the other kinds of protection 
referred to in Article 43, designation shall mean that the desired protection 
consists of the grant of a patent by or for the designated State.  For the purposes 
of this paragraph, Article 2(ii) shall not apply. 
 
(4)  Failure to indicate in the request the name and other prescribed data 
concerning the inventor shall have no consequence in any designated State 
whose national law requires the furnishing of the said indications but allows 
that they be furnished at a time later than that of the filing of a national 
application.  Failure to furnish the said indications in a separate notice shall 
have no consequence in any designated State whose national law does not 
require the furnishing of the said indications. 
Article 5 
The Description 
 
The description shall disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear 
and complete for the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art. 
Article 6 
The Claims 
 
The claim or claims shall define the matter for which protection is sought.  
Claims shall be clear and concise.  They shall be fully supported by the 
description. 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
11 
Article 7 
The Drawings 
 
(1)  Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2)(ii), drawings shall be required 
when they are necessary for the understanding of the invention. 
 
(2)  Where, without being necessary for the understanding of the invention, 
the nature of the invention admits of illustration by drawings: 
 
(i) the applicant may include such drawings in the international 
application when filed, 
 
(ii) any designated Office may require that the applicant file such 
drawings with it within the prescribed time limit. 
Article 8 
Claiming Priority 
 
(1)  The international application may contain a declaration, as prescribed in 
the Regulations, claiming the priority of one or more earlier applications filed in 
or for any country party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial 
Property. 
 
(2)(a)  Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b), the conditions for, and 
the effect of, any priority claim declared under paragraph (1) shall be as 
provided in Article 4 of the Stockholm Act of the Paris Convention for the 
Protection of Industrial Property. 
 
(b)  The international application for which the priority of one or more 
earlier applications filed in or for a Contracting State is claimed may contain the 
designation of that State.  Where, in the international application, the priority of 
one or more national applications filed in or for a designated State is claimed, or 
where the priority of an international application having designated only one 
State is claimed, the conditions for, and the effect of, the priority claim in that 
State shall be governed by the national law of that State. 
Article 9 
The Applicant 
 
(1)  Any resident or national of a Contracting State may file an international 
application. 
 
(2)  The Assembly may decide to allow the residents and the nationals of 
any country party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial 
Property which is not party to this Treaty to file international applications. 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
12 
 
(3)  The concepts of residence and nationality, and the application of those 
concepts in cases where there are several applicants or where the applicants are 
not the same for all the designated States, are defined in the Regulations. 
Article 10

at the time of receipt, fulfill the requirements listed in paragraph (1), it shall, as 
provided in the Regulations, invite the applicant to file the required correction. 
 
(b)  If the applicant complies with the invitation, as provided in the 
Regulations, the receiving Office shall accord as the international filing date the 
date of receipt of the required correction. 
 
(3)  Subject to Article 64(4), any international application fulfilling the 
requirements listed in items (i) to (iii) of paragraph (1) and accorded an 
international filing date shall have the effect of a regular national application in 
each designated State as of the international filing date, which date shall be 
considered to be the actual filing date in each designated State. 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
13 
 
(4)  Any international application fulfilling the requirements listed in 
items (i) to (iii) of paragraph (1) shall be equivalent to a regular national filing

Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
14 
Article 14 
Certain Defects in the International Application 
 
(1)(a)  The receiving Office shall check whether the international application 
contains any of the following defects, that is to say: 
 
(i) it is not signed as provided in the Regulations; 
 
(ii) it does not contain the prescribed indications concerning the 
applicant; 
 
(iii) it does not contain a title; 
 
(iv) it does not contain an abstract;

the prescribed physical requirements. 
 
(b)  If the receiving Office finds any of the said defects, it shall invite the 
applicant to correct the international application within the prescribed time 
limit, failing which that application shall be considered withdrawn and the 
receiving Office shall so declare. 
 
(2)  If the international application refers to drawings which, in fact, are not 
included in that application, the receiving Office shall notify the applicant 
accordingly and he may furnish them within the prescribed time limit and, if he 
does, the international filing date shall be the date on which the drawings are 
received by the receiving Office.  Otherwise, any reference to the said drawings 
shall be considered non-existent. 
 
(3)(a)  If the receiving Office finds that, within the prescribed time limits, 
the fees prescribed under Article 3(4)(iv) have not been paid, or no fee 
prescribed under Article 4(2) has been paid in respect of any of the designated 
States, the international application shall be considered withdrawn and the 
receiving Office shall so declare. 
 
(b)  If the receiving Office finds that the fee prescribed under Article 4(2) 
has been paid in respect of one or more (but less than all) designated States 
within the prescribed time limit, the designation of those States in respect of 
which it has not been paid within the prescribed time limit shall be considered 
withdrawn and the receiving Office shall so declare. 
 
(4)  If, after having accorded an international filing date to the international 
application, the receiving Office finds, within the prescribed time limit, that any 
of the requirements listed in items (i) to (iii) of Article 11(1) was not complied

receiving Office shall so declare. 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
15 
Article 15 
The International Search 
 
(1)  Each international application shall be the subject of international 
search. 
 
(2)  The objective of the international search is to discover relevant prior art. 
 
(3)  International search shall be made on the basis of the claims, with due 
regard to the description and the drawings (if any). 
 
(4)  The International Searching Authority referred to in Article 16 shall 
endeavor to discover as much of the relevant prior art as its facilities permit, and 
shall, in any case, consult the documentation specified in the Regulations. 
 
(5)(a)  If the national law of the Contracting State so permits, the applicant 
who files a national application with the national Office of or acting for such 
State may, subject to the conditions provided for in such law, request that a 
search similar to an international search (“international-type search”) be carried 
out on such application. 
 
(b)  If the national law of the Contracting State so permits, the national 
Office of or acting for such State may subject any national application filed with 
it to an international-type search. 
 
(c)  The international-type search shall be carried out by the International 
Searching Authority referred to in Article 16 which would be competent for an 
international search if the national application were an international application 
and were filed with the Office referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b).  If the 
national application is in a language which the International Searching 
Authority considers it is not equipped to handle, the international-type search 
shall be carried out on a translation prepared by the applicant in a language 
prescribed for international applications and which the International Searching 
Authority has undertaken to accept for international applications.  The national 
application and the translation, when required, shall be presented in the form 
prescribed for international applications. 
Article 16 
The International Searching Authority 
 
(1)  International search shall be carried out by an International Searching 
Authority, which may be either a national Office or an intergovernmental 
organization, such as the International Patent Institute, whose tasks include the 
establishing of documentary search reports on prior art with respect to 
inventions which are the subject of applications. 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
16 
 
(2)  If, pending the establishment of a single International Searching 
Authority, there are several International Searching Authorities, each receiving 
Office shall, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable agreement 
referred to in paragraph (3)(b), specify the International Searching Authority or 
Authorities competent for the searching of international applications filed with 
such Office. 
 
(3)(a)  International Searching Authorities shall be appointed by the 
Assembly.  Any national Office and any intergovernmental organization 
satisfying the requirements referred to in subparagraph (c) may be appointed as 
International Searching Authority. 
 
(b)  Appointment shall be conditional on the consent of the national 
Office or intergovernmental organization to be appointed and the conclusion of 
an agreement, subject to approval by the Assembly, between such Office or 
organization and the International Bureau.  The agreement shall specify the 
rights and obligations of the parties, in particular, the formal undertaking by the 
said Office or organization to apply and observe all the common rules of 
international search. 
 
(c)  The Regulations prescribe the minimum requirements, particularly as 
to manpower and documentation, which any Office or organization must satisfy 
before it can be appointed and must continue to satisfy while it remains 
appointed. 
 
(d)  Appointment shall be for a fixed period of time and may be extended 
for further periods. 
 
(e)  Before the Assembly makes a decision on the appointment of any 
national Office or intergovernmental organization, or on the extension of its 
appointment, or before it allows any such appointment to lapse, the Assembly 
shall hear the interested Office or organization and seek the advice of the 
Committee for Technical Cooperation referred to in Article 56 once that 
Committee has been established. 
Article 17 
Procedure before the International Searching Authority 
 
(1)  Procedure before the International Searching Authority shall be 
governed by the provisions of this Treaty, the Regulations, and the agreement 
which the International Bureau shall conclude, subject to this Treaty and the 
Regulations, with the said Authority. 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
17 
 
(2)(a)  If the International Searching Authority considers 
 
(i) that the international application relates to a subject matter which 
the International Searching Authority is not required, under the 
Regulations, to search, and in the particular case decides not to 
search, or 
 
(ii) that the description, the claims, or the drawings, fail to comply 
with the prescribed requirements to such an extent that a 
meaningful search could not be carried out, 
the said Authority shall so declare and shall notify the applicant and the 
International Bureau that no international search report will be established. 
 
(b)  If any of the situations referred to in subparagraph (a) is found to 
exist in connection with certain claims only, the international search report shall 
so indicate in respect of such claims, whereas, for the other claims, the said 
report shall be established as provided in Article 18. 
 
(3)(a)  If the International Searching Authority considers that the 
international application does not comply with the requirement of unity of 
invention as set forth in the Regulations, it shall invite the applicant to pay 
additional fees.  The International Searching Authority shall establish the 
international search report on those parts of the international application which 
relate to the invention first mentioned in the claims (“main invention”) and, 
provided the required additional fees have been paid within the prescribed time 
limit, on those parts of the international application which relate to inventions in 
respect of which the said fees were paid. 
 
(b)  The national law of any designated State may provide that, where the 
national Office of that State finds the invitation, referred to in subparagraph (a), 
of the International Searching Authority justified and where the applicant has 
not paid all additional fees, those parts of the international application which 
consequently have not been searched shall, as far as effects in that State are 
concerned, be considered withdrawn unless a special fee is paid by the applicant 
to the national Office of that State. 
Article 18 
The International Search Report 
 
(1)  The international search report shall be established within the prescribed 
time limit and in the prescribed form.

Article 17(2)(a) shall be translated as provided in the Regulations.  The 
translations shall be prepared by or under the responsibility of the International 
Bureau. 
Article 19 
Amendment of the Claims before the International Bureau 
 
(1)  The applicant shall, after having received the international search report, 
be entitled to one opportunity to amend the claims of the international 
application by filing amendments with the International Bureau within the 
prescribed time limit.  He may, at the same time, file a brief statement, as 
provided in the Regulations, explaining the amendments and indicating any 
impact that such amendments might have on the description and the drawings. 
 
(2)  The amendments shall not go beyond the disclosure in the international 
application as filed. 
 
(3)  If the national law of any designated State permits amendments to go 
beyond the said disclosure, failure to comply with paragraph (2) shall have no 
consequence in that State. 
Article 20 
Communication to Designated Offices 
 
(1)(a)  The international application, together with the international search 
report (including any indication referred to in Article 17(2)(b)) or the 
declaration referred to in Article 17(2)(a), shall be communicated to each 
designated Office, as provided in the Regulations, unless the designated Office 
waives such requirement in its entirety or in part. 
 
(b)  The communication shall include the translation (as prescribed) of 
the said report or declaration. 
 
(2)  If the claims have been amended by virtue of Article 19(1), the

(5)  There shall be no international publication if the international 
application is withdrawn or is considered withdrawn before the technical 
preparations for publication have been completed. 
 
(6)  If the international application contains expressions or drawings which, 
in the opinion of the International Bureau, are contrary to morality or public 
order, or if, in its opinion, the international application contains disparaging 
statements as defined in the Regulations, it may omit such expressions, 
drawings, and statements, from its publications, indicating the place and number 
of words or drawings omitted, and furnishing, upon request, individual copies 
of the passages omitted. 
Article 22

(1)  The applicant shall furnish a copy of the international application 
(unless the communication provided for in Article 20 has already taken place) 
and a translation thereof (as prescribed), and pay the national fee (if any), to 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
20 
each designated Office not later than at the expiration of 301 months from the 
priority date.  Where the national law of the designated State requires the 
indication of the name of and other prescribed data concerning the inventor but 
allows that these indications be furnished at a time later than that of the filing of 
a national application, the applicant shall, unless they were contained in the 
request, furnish the said indications to the national Office of or acting for the 
State not later than at the expiration of 301 months from the priority date. 
 
(2)  Where the International Searching Authority makes a declaration, under 
Article 17(2)(a), that no international search report will be established, the time 
limit for performing the acts referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article shall be 
the same as that provided for in paragraph (1).

within the applicable time limit. 
 
(2)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), any designated Office 
may maintain the effect provided for in Article 11(3) even where such effect is 
not required to be maintained by virtue of Article 25(2). 
Article 25 
Review by Designated Offices 
 
(1)(a)  Where the receiving Office has refused to accord an international 
filing date or has declared that the international application is considered 
withdrawn, or where the International Bureau has made a finding under 
Article 12(3), the International Bureau shall promptly send, at the request of the 
applicant, copies of any document in the file to any of the designated Offices 
named by the applicant. 
 
(b)  Where the receiving Office has declared that the designation of any 
given State is considered withdrawn, the International Bureau shall promptly 
send, at the request of the applicant, copies of any document in the file to the 
national Office of such State. 
 
(c)  The request under subparagraphs (a) or (b) shall be presented within 
the prescribed time limit. 
 
(2)(a)  Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b), each designated Office 
shall, provided that the national fee (if any) has been paid and the appropriate 
translation (as prescribed) has been furnished within the prescribed time limit, 
decide whether the refusal, declaration, or finding, referred to in paragraph (1) 
was justified under the provisions of this Treaty and the Regulations, and, if it 
finds that the refusal or declaration was the result of an error or omission on the 
part of the receiving Office or that the finding was the result of an error or 
omission on the part of the International Bureau, it shall, as far as effects in the 
State of the designated Office are concerned, treat the international application 
as if such error or omission had not occurred. 
 
(b)  Where the record copy has reached the International Bureau after the 
expiration of the time limit prescribed under Article 12(3) on account of any 
error or omission on the part of the applicant, the provisions of subparagraph (a) 
shall apply only under the circumstances referred to in Article 48(2). 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
22 
Article 26 
Opportunity to Correct before Designated Offices 
 
No designated Office shall reject an international application on the grounds 
of non-compliance with the requirements of this Treaty and the Regulations 
without first giving the applicant the opportunity to correct the said application 
to the extent and according to the procedure provided by the national law for the 
same or comparable situations in respect of national applications. 
Article 27 
National Requirements 
 
(1)  No national law shall require compliance with requirements relating to 
the form or contents of the international application different from or additional 
to those which are provided for in this Treaty and the Regulations. 
 
(2)  The provisions of paragraph (1) neither affect the application of the 
provisions of Article 7(2) nor preclude any national law from requiring, once 
the processing of the international application has started in the designated 
Office, the furnishing: 
 
(i) when the applicant is a legal entity, of the name of an officer entitled 
to represent such legal entity, 
 
(ii) of documents not part of the international application but which 
constitute proof of allegations or statements made in that application, including 
the confirmation of the international application by the signature of the 
applicant when that application, as filed, was signed by his representative or 
agent. 
 
(3)  Where the applicant, for the purposes of any designated State, is not 
qualified according to the national law of that State to file a national application 
because he is not the inventor, the international application may be rejected by 
the designated Office. 
 
(4)  Where the national law provides, in respect of the form or contents of 
national applications, for requirements which, from the viewpoint of applicants, 
are more favorable than the requirements provided for by this Treaty and the 
Regulations in respect of international applications, the national Office, the 
courts and any other competent organs of or acting for the designated State may 
apply the former requirements, instead of the latter requirements, to 
international applications, except where the applicant insists that the 
requirements provided for by this Treaty and the Regulations be applied to his 
international application. 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
23 
 
(5)  Nothing in this Treaty and the Regulations is intended to be construed 
as prescribing anything that would limit the freedom of each Contracting State 
to prescribe such substantive conditions of patentability as it desires.  In 
particular, any provision in this Treaty and the Regulations concerning the 
definition of prior art is exclusively for the purposes of the international 
procedure and, consequently, any Contracting State is free to apply, when 
determining the patentability of an invention claimed in an international 
application, the criteria of its national law in respect of prior art and other 
conditions of patentability not constituting requirements as to the form and 
contents of applications. 
 
(6)  The national law may require that the applicant furnish evidence in 
respect of any substantive condition of patentability prescribed by such law. 
 
(7)  Any receiving Office or, once the processing of the international 
application has started in the designated Office, that Office may apply the 
national law as far as it relates to any requirement that the applicant be 
represented by an agent having the right to represent applicants before the said 
Office and/or that the applicant have an address in the designated State for the 
purpose of receiving notifications. 
 
(8)  Nothing in this Treaty and the Regulations is intended to be construed 
as limiting the freedom of any Contracting State to apply measures deemed 
necessary for the preservation of its national security or to limit, for the 
protection of the general economic interests of that State, the right of its own 
residents or nationals to file international applications. 
 
Article 28 
Amendment of the Claims, the Description,  
and the Drawings, before Designated Offices 
 
(1)  The applicant shall be given the opportunity to amend the claims, the 
description, and the drawings, before each designated Office within the 
prescribed time limit.  No designated Office shall grant a patent, or refuse the 
grant of a patent, before such time limit has expired except with the express 
consent of the applicant. 
 
(2)  The amendments shall not go beyond the disclosure in the international 
application as filed unless the national law of the designated State permits them 
to go beyond the said disclosure. 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
24 
 
(3)  The amendments shall be in accordance with the national law of the 
designated State in all respects not provided for in this Treaty and the 
Regulations. 
 
(4)  Where the designated Office requires a translation of the international 
application, the amendments shall be in the language of the translation. 
Article 29 
Effects of the International Publication 
 
(1)  As far as the protection of any rights of the applicant in a designated 
State is concerned, the effects, in that State, of the international publication of 
an international application shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (2) 
to (4), be the same as those which the national law of the designated State 
provides for the compulsory national publication of unexamined national 
applications as such. 
 
(2)  If the language in which the international publication has been effected 
is different from the language in which publications under the national law are 
effected in the designated State, the said national law may provide that the 
effects provided for in paragraph (1) shall be applicable only from such time as: 
 
(i) a translation into the latter language has been published as provided 
by the national law, or 
 
(ii) a translation into the latter language has been made available to the 
public, by laying open for public inspection as provided by the national law, or 
 
(iii) a translation into the latter language has been transmitted by the 
applicant to the actual or prospective unauthorized user of the invention claimed 
in the international application, or 
 
(iv) both the acts described in (i) and (iii), or both the acts described 
in (ii) and (iii), have taken place. 
 
(3)  The national law of any designated State may provide that, where the 
international publication has been effected, on the request of the applicant, 
before the expiration of 18 months from the priority date, the effects provided 
for in paragraph (1) shall be applicable only from the expiration of 18 months 
from the priority date. 
 
(4)  The national law of any designated State may provide that the effects 
provided for in paragraph (1) shall be applicable only from the date on which a 
copy of the international application as published under Article 21 has been 
received in the national Office of or acting for such State.  The said Office shall 
publish the date of receipt in its gazette as soon as possible. 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty

Article 30 
Confidential Nature of the International Application 
 
(1)(a)  Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b), the International 
Bureau and the International Searching Authorities shall not allow access by 
any person or authority to the international application before the international 
publication of that application, unless requested or authorized by the applicant. 
 
(b)  The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not apply to any transmittal 
to the competent International Searching Authority, to transmittals provided for 
under Article 13, and to communications provided for under Article 20. 
 
(2)(a)  No national Office shall allow access to the international application 
by third parties, unless requested or authorized by the applicant, before the 
earliest of the following dates: 
 
(i) date of the international publication of the international 
application, 
 
(ii) date of the receipt of the communication of the international 
application under Article 20, 
 
(iii) date of the receipt of a copy of the international application under 
Article 22. 
 
(b)  The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not prevent any national 
Office from informing third parties that it has been designated, or from 
publishing that fact.  Such information or publication may, however, contain 
only the following data:  identification of the receiving Office, name of the 
applicant, international filing date, international application number, and title of 
the invention. 
 
(c)  The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not prevent any designated 
Office from allowing access to the international application for the purposes of 
the judicial authorities. 
 
(3)  The provisions of paragraph (2)(a) shall apply to any receiving Office 
except as far as transmittals provided for under Article 12(1) are concerned. 
 
(4)  For the purposes of this Article, the term “access” covers any means by 
which 
third 
parties 
may 
acquire 
cognizance, 
including 
individual 
communication and general publication, provided, however, that no national 
Office shall generally publish an international application or its translation 
before the international publication or, if international publication has not taken 
place by the expiration of 20 months from the priority date, before the 
expiration of 20 months from the said priority date.

CHAPTER II 
INTERNATIONAL PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION 
Article 31 
Demand for International Preliminary Examination 
 
(1)  On the demand of the applicant, his international application shall be the 
subject of an international preliminary examination as provided in the following 
provisions and the Regulations. 
 
(2)(a)  Any applicant who is a resident or national, as defined in the 
Regulations, of a Contracting State bound by Chapter II, and whose 
international application has been filed with the receiving Office of or acting for 
such State, may make a demand for international preliminary examination. 
 
(b)  The Assembly may decide to allow persons entitled to file 
international applications to make a demand for international preliminary 
examination even if they are residents or nationals of a State not party to this 
Treaty or not bound by Chapter II. 
 
(3)  The demand for international preliminary examination shall be made 
separately from the international application.  The demand shall contain the 
prescribed particulars and shall be in the prescribed language and form. 
 
(4)(a)  The demand shall indicate the Contracting State or States in which 
the applicant intends to use the results of the international preliminary 
examination (“elected States”).  Additional Contracting States may be elected 
later.  Election may relate only to Contracting States already designated under 
Article 4. 
 
(b)  Applicants referred to in paragraph (2)(a) may elect any Contracting 
State bound by Chapter II.  Applicants referred to in paragraph (2)(b) may elect 
only such Contracting States bound by Chapter II as have declared that they are 
prepared to be elected by such applicants.

Article 32 
The International Preliminary Examining Authority 
 
(1)  International preliminary examination shall be carried out by the 
International Preliminary Examining Authority. 
 
(2)  In the case of demands referred to in Article 31(2)(a), the receiving 
Office, and, in the case of demands referred to in Article 31(2)(b), the 
Assembly, shall, in accordance with the applicable agreement between the 
interested International Preliminary Examining Authority or Authorities and the 
International Bureau, specify the International Preliminary Examining Authority 
or Authorities competent for the preliminary examination. 
 
(3)  The provisions of Article 16(3) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, in respect 
of International Preliminary Examining Authorities. 
Article 33 
The International Preliminary Examination 
 
(1)  The objective of the international preliminary examination is to 
formulate a preliminary and non-binding opinion on the questions whether the 
claimed invention appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step (to be 
non-obvious), and to be industrially applicable. 
 
(2)  For the purposes of the international preliminary examination, a claimed 
invention shall be considered novel if it is not anticipated by the prior art as 
defined in the Regulations. 
 
(3)  For the purposes of the international preliminary examination, a claimed 
invention shall be considered to involve an inventive step if, having regard to 
the prior art as defined in the Regulations, it is not, at the prescribed relevant 
date, obvious to a person skilled in the art. 
 
(4)  For the purposes of the international preliminary examination, a claimed 
invention shall be considered industrially applicable if, according to its nature, 
it can be made or used (in the technological sense) in any kind of industry.  
“Industry” shall be understood in its broadest sense, as in the Paris Convention 
for the Protection of Industrial Property. 
 
(5)  The criteria described above merely serve the purposes of international 
preliminary examination.  Any Contracting State may apply additional or 
different criteria for the purpose of deciding whether, in that State, the claimed 
invention is patentable or not. 
 
(6)  The international preliminary examination shall take into consideration 
all the documents cited in the international search report.  It may take into 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
28 
consideration any additional documents considered to be relevant in the 
particular case. 
Article 34 
Procedure before the International Preliminary Examining Authority 
 
(1)  Procedure before the International Preliminary Examining Authority 
shall be governed by the provisions of this Treaty, the Regulations, and the 
agreement which the International Bureau shall conclude, subject to this Treaty 
and the Regulations, with the said Authority. 
 
(2)(a)  The applicant shall have a right to communicate orally and in writing 
with the International Preliminary Examining Authority. 
 
(b)  The applicant shall have a right to amend the claims, the description, 
and the drawings, in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed time limit, 
before the international preliminary examination report is established.  The 
amendment shall not go beyond the disclosure in the international application as 
filed. 
 
(c)  The applicant shall receive at least one written opinion from the 
International Preliminary Examining Authority unless such Authority considers 
that all of the following conditions are fulfilled: 
 
(i) the invention satisfies the criteria set forth in Article 33(1), 
 
(ii) the international application complies with the requirements of 
this Treaty and the Regulations in so far as checked by that Authority, 
 
(iii) no observations are intended to be made under Article 35(2), last 
sentence. 
 
(d)  The applicant may respond to the written opinion. 
 
(3)(a)  If the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers that 
the international application does not comply with the requirement of unity of 
invention as set forth in the Regulations, it may invite the applicant, at his 
option, to restrict the claims so as to comply with the requirement or to pay 
additional fees. 
 
(b)  The national law of any elected State may provide that, where the 
applicant chooses to restrict the claims under subparagraph (a), those parts of 
the international application which, as a consequence of the restriction, are not 
to be the subject of international preliminary examination shall, as far as effects 
in that State are concerned, be considered withdrawn unless a special fee is paid 
by the applicant to the national Office of that State. 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
29 
 
(c)  If the applicant does not comply with the invitation referred to in 
subparagraph (a) within the prescribed time limit, the International Preliminary 
Examining Authority shall establish an international preliminary examination 
report on those parts of the international application which relate to what 
appears to be the main invention and shall indicate the relevant facts in the said 
report.  The national law of any elected State may provide that, where its 
national Office finds the invitation of the International Preliminary Examining 
Authority justified, those parts of the international application which do not 
relate to the main invention shall, as far as effects in that State are concerned, be 
considered withdrawn unless a special fee is paid by the applicant to that Office. 
 
(4)(a)  If the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers 
 
(i) that the international application relates to a subject matter on 
which the International Preliminary Examining Authority is not 
required, under the Regulations, to carry out an international 
preliminary examination, and in the particular case decides not to 
carry out such examination, or 
 
(ii) that the description, the claims, or the drawings, are so unclear, or 
the claims are so inadequately supported by the description, that 
no meaningful opinion can be formed on the novelty, inventive 
step (non-obviousness), or industrial applicability, of the claimed 
invention, 
the said Authority shall not go into the questions referred to in Article 33(1) and 
shall inform the applicant of this opinion and the reasons therefor. 
 
(b)  If any of the situations referred to in subparagraph (a) is found to 
exist in, or in connection with, certain claims only, the provisions of that 
subparagraph shall apply only to the said claims. 
Article 35 
The International Preliminary Examination Report 
 
(1)  The international preliminary examination report shall be established 
within the prescribed time limit and in the prescribed form. 
 
(2)  The international preliminary examination report shall not contain any 
statement on the question whether the claimed invention is or seems to be 
patentable or unpatentable according to any national law.  It shall state, subject 
to the provisions of paragraph (3), in relation to each claim, whether the claim 
appears to satisfy the criteria of novelty, inventive step (non-obviousness), and 
industrial applicability, as defined for the purposes of the international 
preliminary examination in Article 33(1) to (4).  The statement shall be 
accompanied by the citation of the documents believed to support the stated 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
30 
conclusion with such explanations as the circumstances of the case may require.  
The statement shall also be accompanied by such other observations as the 
Regulations provide for. 
 
(3)(a)  If, at the time of establishing the international preliminary 
examination report, the International Preliminary Examining Authority 
considers that any of the situations referred to in Article 34(4)(a) exists, that 
report shall state this opinion and the reasons therefor.  It shall not contain any 
statement as provided in paragraph (2). 
 
(b)  If a situation under Article 34(4)(b) is found to exist, the international 
preliminary examination report shall, in relation to the claims in question, 
contain the statement as provided in subparagraph (a), whereas, in relation to 
the other claims, it shall contain the statement as provided in paragraph (2). 
Article 36 
Transmittal, Translation, and Communication,  
of the International Preliminary Examination Report 
 
(1)  The international preliminary examination report, together with the 
prescribed annexes, shall be transmitted to the applicant and to the International 
Bureau. 
 
(2)(a)  The international preliminary examination report and its annexes 
shall be translated into the prescribed languages. 
 
(b)  Any translation of the said report shall be prepared by or under the 
responsibility of the International Bureau, whereas any translation of the said 
annexes shall be prepared by the applicant. 
 
(3)(a)  The international preliminary examination report, together with its 
translation (as prescribed) and its annexes (in the original language), shall be 
communicated by the International Bureau to each elected Office. 
 
(b)  The prescribed translation of the annexes shall be transmitted within 
the prescribed time limit by the applicant to the elected Offices. 
 
(4)  The provisions of Article 20(3) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to copies 
of any document which is cited in the international preliminary examination 
report and which was not cited in the international search report. 
Article 37 
Withdrawal of Demand or Election 
 
(1)  The applicant may withdraw any or all elections. 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
31 
 
(2)  If the election of all elected States is withdrawn, the demand shall be 
considered withdrawn. 
 
(3)(a)  Any withdrawal shall be notified to the International Bureau. 
 
(b)  The elected Offices concerned and the International Preliminary 
Examining Authority concerned shall be notified accordingly by the 
International Bureau. 
 
(4)(a)  Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b), withdrawal of the 
demand or of the election of a Contracting State shall, unless the national law of 
that State provides otherwise, be considered to be withdrawal of the 
international application as far as that State is concerned. 
 
(b)  Withdrawal of the demand or of the election shall not be considered 
to be withdrawal of the international application if such withdrawal is effected 
prior to the expiration of the applicable time limit under Article 22;  however, 
any Contracting State may provide in its national law that the aforesaid shall 
apply only if its national Office has received, within the said time limit, a copy 
of the international application, together with a translation (as prescribed), and 
the national fee. 
Article 38 
Confidential Nature of the International Preliminary Examination 
 
(1)  Neither the International Bureau nor the International Preliminary 
Examining Authority shall, unless requested or authorized by the applicant, 
allow access within the meaning, and with the proviso, of Article 30(4) to the 
file of the international preliminary examination by any person or authority at 
any time, except by the elected Offices once the international preliminary 
examination report has been established. 
 
(2)  Subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) and Articles 36(1) and (3) 
and 37(3)(b), neither the International Bureau nor the International Preliminary 
Examining Authority shall, unless requested or authorized by the applicant, give 
information on the issuance or nonissuance of an international preliminary 
examination report and on the withdrawal or nonwithdrawal of the demand or of 
any election. 
Article 39 
Copy, Translation, and Fee, to Elected Offices 
 
(1)(a)  If the election of any Contracting State has been effected prior to the 
expiration of the 19th month from the priority date, the provisions of Article 22 
shall not apply to such State and the applicant shall furnish a copy of the 
 
Patent Cooperation Treaty 
 
 
 
32 
international application (unless the communication under Article 20 has 
already taken place) and a translation thereof (as prescribed), and pay the 
national fee (if any), to each elected Office not later than at the expiration of 
30 months from the priority date. 
 
(b)  Any national law may, for performing the acts referred to in 
subparagraph (a), fix time limits which expire later than the time limit provided 
for in that subparagraph. 
 
(2)  The effect provided for in Article 11(3) shall cease in the elected State 
with the same consequences as the withdrawal of any national application in 
that State if the applicant fails to perform the acts referred to in paragraph (1)(a) 
within the time limit applicable under paragraph (1)(a) or (b). 
 
(3)  Any elected Office may maintain the effect provided for in Article 11(3) 
even where the applicant does not comply with the requirements provided for in 
paragraph (1)(a) or (b). 
Article 40 
Delaying of National Examination and Other Processing 
 
(1)  If the election of any Contracting State has been effected prior to the 
expiration of the 19th month from the priority date, the provisions of Article 23 
shall not apply to such State and the national Office of or acting for that State 
shall not proceed, subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), to the examination 
and other processing of the international application prior to the expiration of 
the applicable time limit under Article 39. 
 
(2)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), any elected Office 
may, on the express request of the applicant, proceed to the examination and 
other processing of the international application at any time. 
Article 41 
Amendment of the Claims, the Description, 
and the Drawings, before Elected Offices 
 
(1)  The applicant shall be given the opportunity to amend the claims, the

Seeking Certain Kinds of Protection 
 
In respect of any designated or elected State whose law provides for the 
grant of inventors’ certificates, utility certificates, utility models, patents or 
certificates of addition, inventors’ certificates of addition, or utility certificates 
of addition, the applicant may indicate, as prescribed in the Regulations, that his 
international application is for the grant, as far as that State is concerned, of an 
inventor’s certificate, a utility certificate, or a utility model, rather than a patent, 
or that it is for the grant of a patent or certificate of addition, an inventor’s 
certificate of addition, or a utility certificate of addition, and the ensuing effect

regional patent treaty. 
Article 46 
Incorrect Translation of the International Application 
 
If, because of an incorrect translation of the international application, the 
scope of any patent granted on that application exceeds the scope of the 
international application in its original language, the competent authorities of 
the Contracting State concerned may accordingly and retroactively limit the 
scope of the patent, and declare it null and void to the extent that its scope has 
exceeded the scope of the international application in its original language.

of a Contracting State provides that the filing of an international application which 
contains the designation of that State and claims the priority of an earlier national 
application having effect in that State shall have the result that the earlier national 
 

 
 
 
76 
application ceases to have effect with the same consequences as the withdrawal 
of the earlier national application, any request in which the priority of an earlier 
national application filed in that State is claimed may contain an indication that 
the designation of that State is not made, provided that the designated Office 
notifies the International Bureau by January 5, 2006, that this paragraph shall 
apply in respect of designations of that State and that the notification is still in 
force on the international filing date.  The information received shall be promptly

entrusted with the granting of regional patents under the applicable regional patent 
treaty; 
 
(v) where the earlier application is an international application, the 
receiving Office with which it was filed. 
 
(b)  In addition to any indication required under paragraph (a)(iv) or (v): 
 
(i) where the earlier application is a regional application or an 
international application, the priority claim may indicate one or more countries 
party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property for which 
that earlier application was filed; 
 
(ii) where the earlier application is a regional application and at least one 
of the countries party to the regional patent treaty is neither party to the Paris 
Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property nor a Member of the World 
Trade Organization, the priority claim shall indicate at least one country party to

(ii) the applicant intends to make an indication under Rule 49bis.1(d) of 
the wish that the international application be treated, in any designated State, as 
an application for a continuation or a continuation-in-part of an earlier application; 
the request shall so indicate and shall indicate the relevant parent application or 
parent patent or other parent grant. 
 
(b)  The inclusion in the request of an indication under paragraph (a) shall 
have no effect on the operation of Rule 4.9. 
4.12   Taking into Account Results of Earlier Search

international, international-type or national search carried out by the same or 
another International Searching Authority or by a national Office (“earlier 
search”): 
 
(i) the request shall so indicate and shall specify the Authority or Office 
concerned and the application in respect of which the earlier search was carried 
out; 
 
(ii) the request may, where applicable, contain a statement to the effect that 
the international application is the same, or substantially the same, as the

to in Rule 20.5(a), or an element or part of the description, claims or drawings 
referred to in Rule 20.5bis(a) is not otherwise contained in the international 
application but is completely contained in the earlier application, that element or 
 

 
 
 
79 
part is, subject to confirmation under Rule 20.6, incorporated by reference in the 
international application for the purposes of Rule 20.6.  Such a statement, if not

that date. 
4.19   Additional Matter 
 
(a)  The request shall contain no matter other than that specified in Rules 4.1 
to 4.18, provided that the Administrative Instructions may permit, but cannot

the Administrative Instructions. 
 
(b)  If the request contains matter other than that specified in Rules 4.1 to 4.18 
or permitted under paragraph (a) by the Administrative Instructions, the receiving

The Description 
5.1   Manner of the Description 
 
(a)  The description shall first state the title of the invention as appearing in 
the request and shall: 
 
(i) specify the technical field to which the invention relates; 
 
(ii) indicate the background art which, as far as known to the applicant, can 
be regarded as useful for the understanding, searching and examination of the 
invention, and, preferably, cite the documents reflecting such art; 
 
(iii) disclose the invention, as claimed, in such terms that the technical 
problem (even if not expressly stated as such) and its solution can be understood, 
and state the advantageous effects, if any, of the invention with reference to the 
background art; 
 
(iv) briefly describe the figures in the drawings, if any; 
 
(v) set forth at least the best mode contemplated by the applicant for 
carrying out the invention claimed;  this shall be done in terms of examples, where 
appropriate, and with reference to the drawings, if any;  where the national law of 
the designated State does not require the description of the best mode but is 
satisfied with the description of any mode (whether it is the best contemplated or 
not), failure to describe the best mode contemplated shall have no effect in that 
State; 
 
(vi) indicate explicitly, when it is not obvious from the description or nature 
of the invention, the way in which the invention is capable of exploitation in 
industry and the way in which it can be made and used, or, if it can only be used, 
 

 
 
 
80 
the way in which it can be used;  the term “industry” is to be understood in its 
broadest sense as in the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. 
 
(b)  The manner and order specified in paragraph (a) shall be followed except 
when, because of the nature of the invention, a different manner or a different 
order would result in a better understanding and a more economic presentation. 
 
(c)  Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b), each of the parts referred to in 
paragraph (a) shall preferably be preceded by an appropriate heading as suggested 
in the Administrative Instructions. 
5.2   Nucleotide and/or Amino Acid Sequence Disclosure 
 
(a)  Where the international application contains disclosure of nucleotide 
and/or amino acid sequences that, pursuant to the Administrative Instructions, are 
required to be included in a sequence listing, the description shall include a 
sequence listing part of the description complying with the standard provided for 
in the Administrative Instructions. 
 
(b)  Language-dependent free text included in the sequence listing part of the 
description shall not be required to be included in the main body of the 
description. 
Rule 6  
The Claims 
6.1   Number and Numbering of Claims 
 
(a)  The number of the claims shall be reasonable in consideration of the 
nature of the invention claimed. 
 
(b)  If there are several claims, they shall be numbered consecutively in 
Arabic numerals. 
 
(c)  The method of numbering in the case of the amendment of claims shall 
be governed by the Administrative Instructions. 
6.2   References to Other Parts of the International Application 
 
(a)  Claims shall not, except where absolutely necessary, rely, in respect of 
the technical features of the invention, on references to the description or 
drawings.  In particular, they shall not rely on such references as:  “as described 
in part ... of the description,” or “as illustrated in figure ... of the drawings.” 
 
(b)  Where the international application contains drawings, the technical 
features mentioned in the claims shall preferably be followed by the reference 
signs relating to such features.  When used, the reference signs shall preferably be 
placed between parentheses.  If inclusion of reference signs does not particularly 
facilitate quicker understanding of a claim, it should not be made.  Reference signs 
 

 
 
 
81 
may be removed by a designated Office for the purposes of publication by such 
Office. 
6.3   Manner of Claiming 
 
(a)  The definition of the matter for which protection is sought shall be in 
terms of the technical features of the invention. 
 
(b)  Whenever appropriate, claims shall contain: 
 
(i) a statement indicating those technical features of the invention which 
are necessary for the definition of the claimed subject matter but which, in 
combination, are part of the prior art, 
 
(ii) a characterizing portion – preceded by the words “characterized in 
that,” “characterized by,” “wherein the improvement comprises,” or any other 
words to the same effect – stating concisely the technical features which, in 
combination with the features stated under (i), it is desired to protect. 
 
(c)  Where the national law of the designated State does not require the 
manner of claiming provided for in paragraph (b), failure to use that manner of 
claiming shall have no effect in that State provided the manner of claiming 
actually used satisfies the national law of that State. 
6.4   Dependent Claims 
 
(a)  Any claim which includes all the features of one or more other claims 
(claim in dependent form, hereinafter referred to as “dependent claim”) shall do 
so by a reference, if possible at the beginning, to the other claim or claims and 
shall then state the additional features claimed.  Any dependent claim which refers 
to more than one other claim (“multiple dependent claim”) shall refer to such 
claims in the alternative only.  Multiple dependent claims shall not serve as a basis 
for any other multiple dependent claim.  Where the national law of the national 
Office acting as International Searching Authority does not allow multiple 
dependent claims to be drafted in a manner different from that provided for in the 
preceding two sentences, failure to use that manner of claiming may result in an 
indication under Article 17(2)(b) in the international search report.  Failure to use 
the said manner of claiming shall have no effect in a designated State if the manner 
of claiming actually used satisfies the national law of that State. 
 
(b)  Any dependent claim shall be construed as including all the limitations 
contained in the claim to which it refers or, if the dependent claim is a multiple 
dependent claim, all the limitations contained in the particular claim in relation to 
which it is considered. 
 
(c)  All dependent claims referring back to a single previous claim, and all 
dependent claims referring back to several previous claims, shall be grouped 
together to the extent and in the most practical way possible.

Any designated State in which the grant of a utility model is sought on the 
basis of an international application may, instead of Rules 6.1 to 6.4, apply in 
respect of the matters regulated in those Rules the provisions of its national law 
concerning utility models once the processing of the international application has 
started in that State, provided that the applicant shall be allowed at least 
two months from the expiration of the time limit applicable under Article 22 to 
adapt his application to the requirements of the said provisions of the national law. 
Rule 7  
The Drawings 
7.1   Flow Sheets and Diagrams 
 
Flow sheets and diagrams are considered drawings. 
7.2   Time Limit 
 
The time limit referred to in Article 7(2)(ii) shall be reasonable under the 
circumstances of the case and shall, in no case, be shorter than two months from 
the date of the written invitation requiring the filing of drawings or additional 
drawings under the said provision. 
Rule 8  
The Abstract 
8.1   Contents and Form of the Abstract 
 
(a)  The abstract shall consist of the following: 
 
(i) a summary of the disclosure as contained in the description, the claims, 
and any drawings;  the summary shall indicate the technical field to which the 
invention pertains and shall be drafted in a way which allows the clear 
understanding of the technical problem, the gist of the solution of that problem 
through the invention, and the principal use or uses of the invention; 
 
(ii) where applicable, the chemical formula which, among all the formulae 
contained in the international application, best characterizes the invention. 
 
(b)  The abstract shall be as concise as the disclosure permits (preferably 50 
to 150 words if it is in English or when translated into English). 
 
(c)  The abstract shall not contain statements on the alleged merits or value of 
the claimed invention or on its speculative application. 
 
(d)  Each main technical feature mentioned in the abstract and illustrated by a 
drawing in the international application shall be followed by a reference sign, 
placed between parentheses. 
 

 
 
 
83 
8.2   Figure 
 
(a)  If the applicant fails to make the indication referred to in Rule 3.3(a)(iii), 
or if the International Searching Authority finds that a figure or figures other than 
that figure or those figures suggested by the applicant would, among all the figures 
of all the drawings, better characterize the invention, it shall, subject to paragraph 
(b), indicate the figure or figures which should accompany the abstract when the 
latter is published by the International Bureau.  In such case, the abstract shall be 
accompanied by the figure or figures so indicated by the International Searching 
Authority.  Otherwise, the abstract shall, subject to paragraph (b), be accompanied 
by the figure or figures suggested by the applicant. 
 
(b)  If the International Searching Authority finds that none of the figures of 
the drawings is useful for the understanding of the abstract, it shall notify the 
International Bureau accordingly.  In such case, the abstract, when published by 
the International Bureau, shall not be accompanied by any figure of the drawings 
even where the applicant has made a suggestion under Rule 3.3(a)(iii). 
8.3   Guiding Principles in Drafting 
 
The abstract shall be so drafted that it can efficiently serve as a scanning tool 
for purposes of searching in the particular art, especially by assisting the scientist, 
engineer or researcher in formulating an opinion on whether there is a need for 
consulting the international application itself. 
Rule 9   
Expressions, Etc., Not to Be Used

the lettering of drawings, the Latin and, where customary, the Greek alphabets 
shall be used. 
 
(i)  The same sheet of drawings may contain several figures.  Where figures 
on two or more sheets form in effect a single complete figure, the figures on the 
several sheets shall be so arranged that the complete figure can be assembled 
without concealing any part of any of the figures appearing on the various sheets. 
 
(j)  The different figures shall be arranged on a sheet or sheets without wasting 
space, preferably in an upright position, clearly separated from one another.  
Where the figures are not arranged in an upright position, they shall be presented 
sideways with the top of the figures at the left side of the sheet. 
 
(k)  The different figures shall be numbered in Arabic numerals consecutively 
and independently of the numbering of the sheets. 
 
(l)  Reference signs not mentioned in the description shall not appear in the 
drawings, and vice versa.

Considered Fulfilled 
 
Where a group of inventions is claimed in one and the same international 
application, the requirement of unity of invention referred to in Rule 13.1 shall be 
fulfilled only when there is a technical relationship among those inventions 
involving one or more of the same or corresponding special technical features.  
The expression “special technical features” shall mean those technical features 
that define a contribution which each of the claimed inventions, considered as a 
whole, makes over the prior art. 
13.3   Determination of Unity of Invention Not Affected by Manner of Claiming 
 
The determination whether a group of inventions is so linked as to form a 
single general inventive concept shall be made without regard to whether the 
inventions are claimed in separate claims or as alternatives within a single claim. 
13.4   Dependent Claims 
 
Subject to Rule 13.1, it shall be permitted to include in the same international 
application a reasonable number of dependent claims, claiming specific forms of 
the invention claimed in an independent claim, even where the features of any 
dependent claim could be considered as constituting in themselves an invention. 
13.5   Utility Models 
 
Any designated State in which the grant of a utility model is sought on the

Rule 13bis   
Inventions Relating to Biological Material 
13bis.1   Definition 
 
For the purposes of this Rule, “reference to deposited biological material” 
means particulars given in an international application with respect to the deposit 
of biological material with a depositary institution or to the biological material so 
deposited. 
13bis.2   References (General) 
 
Any reference to deposited biological material shall be made in accordance 
with this Rule and, if so made, shall be considered as satisfying the requirements 
of the national law of each designated State. 
13bis.3   References:  Contents;  Failure to Include Reference or Indication 
 
(a)  A reference to deposited biological material shall indicate: 
 
(i) the name and the address of the depositary institution with which the 
deposit was made; 
 
(ii) the date of deposit of the biological material with that institution; 
 
(iii) the accession number given to the deposit by that institution;  and 
 
(iv) any additional matter of which the International Bureau has been 
notified pursuant to Rule 13bis.7(a)(i), provided that the requirement to indicate 
that matter was published in the Gazette in accordance with Rule 13bis.7(c) at 
least two months before the filing of the international application. 
 
(b)  Failure to include a reference to deposited biological material or failure 
to include, in a reference to deposited biological material, an indication in 
accordance with paragraph (a), shall have no consequence in any designated State 
whose national law does not require such reference or such indication in a national 
application. 
13bis.4   References:  Time Limit for Furnishing Indications 
 
(a)  Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c), if any of the indications referred to in 
Rule 13bis.3(a) is not included in a reference to deposited biological material in 
the international application as filed but is furnished to the International Bureau: 
 
(i) within 16 months from the priority date, the indication shall be 
considered by any designated Office to have been furnished in time; 
 
(ii) after the expiration of 16 months from the priority date, the indication 
shall be considered by any designated Office to have been furnished on the last 
day of that time limit if it reaches the International Bureau before the technical 
preparations for international publication have been completed. 
 

 
 
 
96 
 
(b)  If the national law applicable by a designated Office so requires in respect 
of national applications, that Office may require that any of the indications 
referred to in Rule 13bis.3(a) be furnished earlier than 16 months from the priority 
date, provided that the International Bureau has been notified of such requirement 
pursuant to Rule 13bis.7(a)(ii) and has published such requirement in the Gazette 
in accordance with Rule 13bis.7(c) at least two months before the filing of the 
international application. 
 
(c)  Where the applicant makes a request for early publication under 
Article 21(2)(b), any designated Office may consider any indication not furnished 
before the technical preparations for international publication have been 
completed as not having been furnished in time. 
 
(d)  The International Bureau shall notify the applicant of the date on which 
it received any indication furnished under paragraph (a), and: 
 
(i) if the indication was received before the technical preparations for 
international publication have been completed, publish the indication furnished 
under paragraph (a), and an indication of the date of receipt, together with the 
international application; 
 
(ii) if the indication was received after the technical preparations for 
international publication have been completed, notify that date and the relevant 
data from the indication to the designated Offices. 
13bis.5   References and Indications for the Purposes of One or More Designated 
States;  Different Deposits for Different Designated States;  Deposits 
with Depositary Institutions Other than Those Notified 
 
(a)  A reference to deposited biological material shall be considered to be 
made for the purposes of all designated States, unless it is expressly made for the

indications included in the reference. 
 
(b)  References to different deposits of the biological material may be made 
for different designated States. 
 
(c)  Any designated Office may disregard a deposit made with a depositary 
institution other than one notified by it under Rule 13bis.7(b). 
13bis.6   Furnishing of Samples 
 
Pursuant to Articles 23 and 40, no furnishing of samples of the deposited 
biological material to which a reference is made in an international application 
shall, except with the authorization of the applicant, take place before the 
expiration of the applicable time limits after which national processing may start 
under the said Articles.  However, where the applicant performs the acts referred 
to in Articles 22 or 39 after international publication but before the expiration of 
 

 
 
 
97 
the said time limits, the furnishing of samples of the deposited biological material 
may take place, once the said acts have been performed.  Notwithstanding the 
previous provision, the furnishing of samples of the deposited biological material 
may take place under the national law applicable by any designated Office as soon 
as, under that law, the international publication has the effects of the compulsory 
national publication of an unexamined national application. 
13bis.7   National Requirements:  Notification and Publication 
 
(a)  Any national Office may notify the International Bureau of any 
requirement of the national law:

carried out without the sequence listing. 
 
(e)  Any sequence listing not contained in the international application as 
filed, whether furnished in response to an invitation under paragraph (a) or 
otherwise, shall not form part of the international application, but this paragraph 
shall not prevent the applicant from amending the description in relation to a 
sequence listing pursuant to Article 34(2)(b).

20.3   Defects under Article 11(1) 
 
(a)  Where, in determining whether the papers purporting to be an 
international application fulfill the requirements of Article 11(1), the receiving 
Office finds that any of the requirements of Article 11(1) are not, or appear not to 
be fulfilled, it shall promptly invite the applicant, at the applicant’s option: 
 
(i) to furnish the required correction under Article 11(2);  or 
 
(ii) where the requirements concerned are those relating to an element 
referred to in Article 11(1)(iii)(d) or (e), to confirm in accordance with 
Rule 20.6(a) that the element is incorporated by reference under Rule 4.18; 
and to make observations, if any, within the applicable time limit under Rule 20.7.  
If that time limit expires after the expiration of 12 months from the filing date of 
any application whose priority is claimed, the receiving Office shall call that 
circumstance to the attention of the applicant. 
 
(b)  Where, following an invitation under paragraph (a) or otherwise: 
 
(i) the applicant furnishes to the receiving Office the required correction 
under Article 11(2) after the date of receipt of the purported international 
application but on a later date falling within the applicable time limit under 
Rule 20.7, the receiving Office shall accord that later date as the international 
filing date and proceed as provided in Rule 20.2(b) and (c); 
 
(ii) an element referred to in Article 11(1)(iii)(d) or (e) is, under 
Rule 20.6(b), considered to have been contained in the international application 
on the date on which one or more elements referred to in Article 11(1)(iii) were 
first received by the receiving Office, the receiving Office shall accord as the 
international filing date the date on which all of the requirements of Article 11(1) 
are fulfilled and proceed as provided in Rule 20.2(b) and (c). 
 
(c)  If the receiving Office later discovers, or on the basis of the applicant’s 
reply realizes, that it has erred in issuing an invitation under paragraph (a) since 
the requirements of Article 11(1) were fulfilled when the papers were received, it 
shall proceed as provided in Rule 20.2. 
20.4   Negative Determination under Article 11(1) 
 
If the receiving Office does not receive, within the applicable time limit under 
Rule 20.7, a correction or confirmation referred to in Rule 20.3(a), or if a 
correction or confirmation has been received but the application still does not 
fulfill the requirements of Article 11(1), the receiving Office shall: 
 
(i) promptly notify the applicant that the application is not and will not be 
treated as an international application and shall indicate the reasons therefor; 
 
(ii) notify the International Bureau that the number it has marked on the 
papers will not be used as an international application number; 
 

 
 
 
109 
 
(iii) keep the papers constituting the purported international application and 
any correspondence relating thereto as provided in Rule 93.1;  and

pursuant to a request by the applicant under Article 25(1), the International Bureau 
needs such a copy and specially asks for it. 
20.5   Missing Parts 
 
(a)  Where, in determining whether the papers purporting to be an 
international application fulfill the requirements of Article 11(1), the receiving 
Office finds that a part of the description, claims or drawings is or appears to be

(“missing part”) but not including the case where an entire element referred to in 
Article 11(1)(iii)(d) or (e) is or appears to be missing and not including the case 
referred to in Rule 20.5bis(a), it shall promptly invite the applicant, at the 
applicant’s option: 
 
(i) to complete the purported international application by furnishing the 
missing part;  or 
 
(ii) to confirm, in accordance with Rule 20.6(a), that the part was 
incorporated by reference under Rule 4.18;

Office, the receiving Office shall accord as the international filing date the date 
on which all of the requirements of Article 11(1) are fulfilled and proceed as 
provided in Rule 20.2(b) and (c). 
 
(e)  Where the international filing date has been corrected under 
paragraph (c), the applicant may, in a notice submitted to the receiving Office 
within one month from the date of the notification under paragraph (c), request

application, the erroneously filed element or part concerned shall be removed 
from the application and the receiving Office shall accord as the international 
filing date the date on which all of the requirements of Article 11(1) are fulfilled

Rule 22  
Transmittal of the Record Copy and Translation 
22.1   Procedure 
 
(a)  If the determination under Article 11(1) is positive, and unless 
prescriptions concerning national security prevent the international application 
from being treated as such, the receiving Office shall transmit the record copy to 
the International Bureau.  Such transmittal shall be effected promptly after receipt 
of the international application or, if a check to preserve national security must be 
performed, as soon as the necessary clearance has been obtained.  In any case, the 
receiving Office shall transmit the record copy in time for it to reach the 
International Bureau by the expiration of the 13th month from the priority date.  If

as being identical with the international application as filed and may transmit such 
certified copy to the International Bureau. 
 
(e)  Any certification under paragraph (d) shall be free of charge and may be 
refused only on any of the following grounds:

identical with the international application as filed; 
 
(ii) prescriptions concerning national security prevent the international 
application from being treated as such; 
 
(iii) the receiving Office has already transmitted the record copy to the

Rule 23  
Transmittal of the Search Copy, Translation and Sequence Listing 
23.1   Procedure 
 
(a)  Where no translation of the international application is required under 
Rule 12.3(a), the search copy shall be transmitted by the receiving Office to the 
International Searching Authority at the latest on the same day as the record copy 
is transmitted to the International Bureau unless no search fee has been paid.  In 
the latter case, it shall be transmitted promptly after payment of the search fee. 
 
(b)  Where a translation of the international application is furnished under 
Rule 12.3, a copy of that translation and of the request, which together shall be 
considered to be the search copy under Article 12(1), shall be transmitted by the

to in Rule 12bis.1(a), the receiving Office shall also transmit to the International 
Searching Authority, together with the search copy, a copy of the results of any 
earlier classification effected by that Office, if already available. 
23bis.2   Transmittal of Documents Relating to Earlier Search or Classification 
for the Purposes of Rule 41.2 
 
(a)  For the purposes of Rule 41.2, where the international application claims 
the priority of one or more earlier applications filed with the same Office as that 
which is acting as the receiving Office and that Office has carried out an earlier 
search in respect of such an earlier application or has classified such earlier 
application, the receiving Office shall, subject to Article 30(2)(a) as applicable by 
virtue of Article 30(3) and paragraphs (b),  (d) and (e), transmit to the 
International Searching Authority, together with the search copy, a copy of the 
results of any such earlier search, in whatever form (for example, in the form of a 
search report, a listing of cited prior art or an examination report) they are 
available to the Office, and a copy of the results of any such earlier classification 
effected by the Office, if already available.  The receiving Office may, subject to 
Article 30(2)(a) as applicable by virtue of Article 30(3), also transmit to the 
International Searching Authority any further documents relating to such an 
earlier search which it considers useful to that Authority for the purposes of 
carrying out the international search. 
 
(b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a receiving Office may notify the 
International Bureau by April 14, 2016 that it may, on request of the applicant 
submitted together with the international application, decide not to transmit the 
results of an earlier search to the International Searching Authority.  The 
International Bureau shall publish any notification under this provision in the 
Gazette.4 
 
(c)  At the option of the receiving Office, paragraph (a) shall apply 
mutatis mutandis where the international application claims the priority of one or 
more earlier applications filed with an Office different from the one which is 
acting as the receiving Office and that Office has carried out an earlier search in 
respect of such an earlier application or has classified such earlier application, and 
the results of any such earlier search or classification are available to the receiving 
Office in a form and manner acceptable to it, for example, from a digital library.

Office is aware that a copy of the earlier search or classification results is available 
to the International Searching Authority in a form and manner acceptable to it, for

referred to in paragraph (a), or the transmission of such copies in a particular form, 
such as those referred to in paragraph (a), without the authorization by the 
applicant is not compatible with the national law applied by the receiving Office, 
that paragraph shall not apply to the transmission of such copies, or to the 
transmission of such copies in the particular form concerned, in respect of any 
international application filed with that receiving Office for as long as such 
transmission without the authorization by the applicant continues not to be 
compatible with that law, provided that the said Office informs the International 
Bureau accordingly by April 14, 2016.  The information received shall be 
promptly published by the International Bureau in the Gazette.5

122 
26.5   Decision of the Receiving Office 
 
The receiving Office shall decide whether the applicant has submitted the 
correction within the applicable time limit under Rule 26.2, and, if the correction 
has been submitted within that time limit, whether the international application so 
corrected is or is not to be considered withdrawn, provided that no international 
application shall be considered withdrawn for lack of compliance with the 
physical requirements referred to in Rule 11 if it complies with those requirements 
to the extent necessary for the purpose of reasonably uniform international 
publication. 
Rule 26bis   
Correction or Addition of Priority Claim 
26bis.1   Correction or Addition of Priority Claim 
 
(a)  The applicant may correct a priority claim or add a priority claim to the 
request by a notice submitted to the receiving Office or the International Bureau 
within a time limit of 16 months from the priority date or, where the correction or 
addition would cause a change in the priority date, 16 months from the priority 
date as so changed, whichever 16-month period expires first, provided that such 
a notice may be submitted until the expiration of four months from the 
international filing date.  The correction of a priority claim may include the 
addition of any indication referred to in Rule 4.10. 
 
(b)  Any notice referred to in paragraph (a) received by the receiving Office 
or the International Bureau after the applicant has made a request for early 
publication under Article 21(2)(b) shall be considered not to have been submitted, 
unless that request is withdrawn before the technical preparations for international 
publication have been completed. 
 
(c)  Where the correction or addition of a priority claim causes a change in the 
priority date, any time limit which is computed from the previously applicable 
priority date and which has not already expired shall be computed from the 
priority date as so changed. 
26bis.2   Defects in Priority Claims 
 
(a)  Where the receiving Office or, if the receiving Office fails to do so, the 
International Bureau, finds in relation to a priority claim: 
 
(i) that the international application has an international filing date which 
is later than the date on which the priority period expired and that a request for 
restoration of the right of priority under Rule 26bis.3 has not been submitted; 
 
(ii) that the priority claim does not comply with the requirements of 
Rule 4.10;  or 
 

 
 
 
123 
 
(iii) that any indication in the priority claim is inconsistent with the 
corresponding indication appearing in the priority document; 
the receiving Office or the International Bureau, as the case may be, shall invite 
the applicant to correct the priority claim.  In the case referred to in item (i), where 
the international filing date is within two months from the date on which the 
priority period expired, the receiving Office or the International Bureau, as the 
case may be, shall also notify the applicant of the possibility of submitting a 
request for the restoration of the right of priority in accordance with Rule 26bis.3, 
unless the receiving Office has notified the International Bureau under 
Rule 26bis.3(j) of the incompatibility of Rule 26bis.3(a) to (i) with the national 
law applied by that Office. 
 
(b)  If the applicant does not, before the expiration of the time limit under 
Rule 26bis.1(a), submit a notice correcting the priority claim, that priority claim 
shall, subject to paragraph (c), for the purposes of the procedure under the Treaty, 
be considered not to have been made (“considered void”) and the receiving Office 
or the International Bureau, as the case may be, shall so declare and shall inform 
the applicant accordingly.  Any notice correcting the priority claim which is 
received before the receiving Office or the International Bureau, as the case may 
be, so declares and not later than one month after the expiration of that time limit 
shall be considered to have been received before the expiration of that time limit. 
 
(c)  A priority claim shall not be considered void only because: 
 
(i) the indication of the number of the earlier application referred to in 
Rule 4.10(a)(ii) is missing; 
 
(ii) an indication in the priority claim is inconsistent with the 
corresponding indication appearing in the priority document;  or 
 
(iii) the international application has an international filing date which is 
later than the date on which the priority period expired, provided that the 
international filing date is within the period of two months from that date. 
 
(d)  Where the receiving Office or the International Bureau has made a 
declaration under paragraph (b) or where the priority claim has not been 
considered void only because paragraph (c) applies, the International Bureau shall 
publish, together with the international application, information concerning the 
priority claim as prescribed by the Administrative Instructions, as well as any 
information submitted by the applicant concerning such priority claim which is 
received by the International Bureau prior to the completion of the technical 
preparations for international publication.  Such information shall be included in 
the communication under Article 20 where the international application is not 
published by virtue of Article 64(3). 
 

 
 
 
124 
 
(e)  Where the applicant wishes to correct or add a priority claim but the time 
limit under Rule 26bis.1 has expired, the applicant may, prior to the expiration of 
30 months from the priority date and subject to the payment of a special fee whose 
amount shall be fixed in the Administrative Instructions, request the International 
Bureau to publish information concerning the matter, and the International Bureau 
shall promptly publish such information. 
26bis.3   Restoration of Right of Priority by Receiving Office 
 
(a)  Where the international application has an international filing date which 
is later than the date on which the priority period expired but within the period of 
two months from that date, the receiving Office shall, on the request of the 
applicant, and subject to paragraphs (b) to (g) of this Rule, restore the right of 
priority if the Office finds that a criterion applied by it (“criterion for restoration”) 
is satisfied, namely, that the failure to file the international application within the 
priority period: 
 
(i) occurred in spite of due care required by the circumstances having been 
taken;  or 
 
(ii) was unintentional. 
Each receiving Office shall apply at least one of those criteria and may apply both 
of them. 
 
(b)  A request under paragraph (a) shall: 
 
(i) be filed with the receiving Office within the time limit applicable under 
paragraph (e); 
 
(ii) state the reasons for the failure to file the international application 
within the priority period;  and 
 
(iii) preferably be accompanied by any declaration or other evidence 
required under paragraph (f). 
 
(c)  Where a priority claim in respect of the earlier application is not contained 
in the international application, the applicant shall submit, within the time limit 
applicable under paragraph (e), a notice under Rule 26bis.1(a) adding the priority 
claim. 
 
(d)  The submission of a request under paragraph (a) may be subjected by the 
receiving Office to the payment to it, for its own benefit, of a fee for requesting 
restoration, payable within the time limit applicable under paragraph (e).  The 
amount of that fee, if any, shall be fixed by the receiving Office.  The time limit 
for payment of the fee may be extended, at the option of the receiving Office, for 
a period of up to two months from the expiration of the time limit applicable under 
paragraph (e). 
 

 
 
 
125 
 
(e)  The time limit referred to in paragraphs (b)(i), (c) and (d) shall be 
two months from the date on which the priority period expired, provided that, 
where the applicant makes a request for early publication under Article 21(2)(b), 
any request under paragraph (a) or any notice referred to in paragraph (c) 
submitted, or any fee referred to in paragraph (d) paid, after the technical 
preparations for international publication have been completed shall be 
considered as not having been submitted or paid in time. 
 
(f)  The receiving Office may require that a declaration or other evidence in 
support of the statement of reasons referred to in paragraph (b)(ii) be filed with it 
within a time limit which shall be reasonable under the circumstances. 
 
(g)  The receiving Office shall not refuse, totally or in part, a request under 
paragraph (a) without giving the applicant the opportunity to make observations 
on the intended refusal within a time limit which shall be reasonable under the 
circumstances.  Such notice of intended refusal by the receiving Office may be 
sent to the applicant together with any invitation to file a declaration or other 
evidence under paragraph (f). 
 
(h)  The receiving Office shall promptly: 
 
(i) notify the International Bureau of the receipt of a request under 
paragraph (a); 
 
(ii) make a decision upon the request; 
 
(iii) notify the applicant and the International Bureau of its decision and the 
criterion for restoration upon which the decision was based; 
 
(iv) subject to paragraph (h-bis), transmit to the International Bureau all 
documents received from the applicant relating to the request under paragraph (a) 
(including a copy of the request itself, any statement of reasons referred to in 
paragraph (b)(ii) and any declaration or other evidence referred to in 
paragraph (f)). 
 
(h-bis)  The receiving Office shall, upon a reasoned request by the applicant 
or on its own decision, not transmit documents or parts thereof received in relation 
to the request under paragraph (a), if it finds that: 
 
(i) this document or part thereof does not obviously serve the purpose of 
informing the public about the international application;  
 
(ii) publication or public access to any such document or part thereof 
would clearly prejudice the personal or economic interests of any person;  and  
 
(iii) there is no prevailing public interest to have access to that document or 
part thereof.   
Where the receiving Office decides not to transmit documents or parts thereof to 
the International Bureau, it shall notify the International Bureau accordingly. 
 

 
 
 
126 
 
(i)  Each receiving Office shall inform the International Bureau of which of 
the criteria for restoration it applies and of any subsequent changes in that respect.  
The International Bureau shall promptly publish such information in the Gazette. 
 
(j)  If, on October 5, 2005, paragraphs (a) to (i) are not compatible with the 
national law applied by the receiving Office, those paragraphs shall not apply in 
respect of that Office for as long as they continue not to be compatible with that 
law, provided that the said Office informs the International Bureau accordingly 
by April 5, 2006.  The information received shall be promptly published by the 
International Bureau in the Gazette.7 
Rule 26ter

26ter.1   Correction or Addition of Declarations 
 
The applicant may correct or add to the request any declaration referred to in 
Rule 4.17 by a notice submitted to the International Bureau within a time limit of 
16 months from the priority date, provided that any notice which is received by 
the International Bureau after the expiration of that time limit shall be considered 
to have been received on the last day of that time limit if it reaches it before the 
technical preparations for international publication have been completed. 
26ter.2   Processing of Declarations 
 
(a)  Where the receiving Office or the International Bureau finds that any 
declaration referred to in Rule 4.17 is not worded as required or, in the case of the

the applicant to correct the declaration within a time limit of 16 months from the 
priority date. 
 
(b)  Where the International Bureau receives any declaration or correction

Extension of Effects of International Application  
to Certain Successor States 
32.1   Extension of International Application to Successor State 
 
(a)  The effects of any international application whose international filing date 
falls in the period defined in paragraph (b) are extended to a State (“the successor 
State”) whose territory was, before the independence of that State, part of the 
territory of a Contracting State designated in the international application which 
subsequently ceased to exist (“the predecessor State”), provided that the successor 
State has become a Contracting State through the deposit, with the Director 
 

 
 
 
130 
General, of a declaration of continuation the effect of which is that the Treaty is 
applied by the successor State. 
 
(b)  The period referred to in paragraph (a) starts on the day following the last 
day of the existence of the predecessor State and ends two months after the date 
on which the declaration referred to in paragraph (a) was notified by the Director 
General to the Governments of the States party to the Paris Convention for the 
Protection of Industrial Property.  However, where the date of independence of 
the successor State is earlier than the date of the day following the last day of the 
existence of the predecessor State, the successor State may declare that the said 
period starts on the date of its independence;  such a declaration shall be made 
together with the declaration referred to in paragraph (a) and shall specify the date 
of independence. 
 
(c)  Information on any international application whose filing date falls within 
the applicable period under paragraph (b) and whose effect is extended to the 
successor State shall be published by the International Bureau in the Gazette. 
32.2   Effects of Extension to Successor State 
 
(a)  Where the effects of the international application are extended to the 
successor State in accordance with Rule 32.1, 
 
(i) the successor State shall be considered as having been designated in 
the international application, and 
 
(ii) the applicable time limit under Article 22 or 39(1) in relation to that 
State shall be extended until the expiration of at least six months from the date of 
the publication of the information under Rule 32.1(c).

provided in paragraph (a)(ii).  The International Bureau shall publish information 
on such time limits in the Gazette. 
Rule 33  
Relevant Prior Art for the International Search 
33.1   Relevant Prior Art for the International Search 
 
(a)  For the purposes of Article 15(2), relevant prior art shall consist of 
everything which has been made available to the public anywhere in the world by 
means of written disclosure (including drawings and other illustrations) and which 
is capable of being of assistance in determining that the claimed invention is or is 
not new and that it does or does not involve an inventive step (i.e., that it is or is 
not obvious), provided that the making available to the public occurred prior to 
the international filing date. 
 

 
 
 
131 
 
(b)  When any written disclosure refers to an oral disclosure, use, exhibition, 
or other means whereby the contents of the written disclosure were made available 
to the public, and such making available to the public occurred on a date prior to 
the international filing date, the international search report shall separately 
mention that fact and the date on which it occurred if the making available to the 
public of the written disclosure occurred on a date which is the same as, or later 
than, the international filing date. 
 
(c)  Any published application or any patent whose publication date is the 
same as, or later than, but whose filing date, or, where applicable, claimed priority 
date, is earlier than the international filing date of the international application 
searched, and which would constitute relevant prior art for the purposes of 
Article 15(2) had it been published prior to the international filing date, shall be 
specially mentioned in the international search report. 
33.2   Fields to Be Covered by the International Search 
 
(a)  The international search shall cover all those technical fields, and shall be 
carried out on the basis of all those search files, which may contain material 
pertinent to the invention. 
 
(b)  Consequently, not only shall the art in which the invention is classifiable 
be searched but also analogous arts regardless of where classified. 
 
(c)  The question what arts are, in any given case, to be regarded as analogous 
shall be considered in the light of what appears to be the necessary essential 
function or use of the invention and not only the specific functions expressly 
indicated in the international application. 
 
(d)  The international search shall embrace all subject matter that is generally 
recognized as equivalent to the subject matter of the claimed invention for all or 
certain of its features, even though, in its specifics, the invention as described in 
the international application is different. 
33.3   Orientation of the International Search 
 
(a)  International search shall be made on the basis of the claims, with due 
regard to the description and the drawings (if any) and with particular emphasis 
on the inventive concept towards which the claims are directed. 
 
(b)  In so far as possible and reasonable, the international search shall cover 
the entire subject matter to which the claims are directed or to which they might 
reasonably be expected to be directed after they have been amended.

Minimum Documentation 
34.1   Definition 
 
(a)  The definitions contained in Article 2(i) and (ii) shall not apply for the 
purposes of this Rule. 
 
(b)  The documentation referred to in Article 15(4) (“minimum 
documentation”) shall consist of: 
 
(i) the “national patent documents” as specified in paragraph (c), 
 
(ii) the published international (PCT) applications, the published regional 
applications for patents and inventors’ certificates, and the published regional 
patents and inventors’ certificates, 
 
(iii) such other published items of non-patent literature as the International 
Searching Authorities shall agree upon and which shall be published in a list by 
the International Bureau when agreed upon for the first time and whenever 
changed. 
 
(c)  Subject to paragraphs (d) and (e), the “national patent documents” shall 
be the following: 
 
(i) the patents issued in and after 1920 by France, the former 
Reichspatentamt of Germany, Japan, the former Soviet Union, Switzerland (in the 
French and German languages only), the United Kingdom, and the United States 
of America, 
 
(ii) the patents issued by the Federal Republic of Germany, the 
People’s Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation, 
 
(iii) the patent applications, if any, published in and after 1920 in the 
countries referred to in items (i) and (ii), 
 
(iv) the inventors’ certificates issued by the former Soviet Union, 
 
(v) the utility certificates issued by, and the published applications for 
utility certificates of, France,

other country after 1920 as are in the English, French, German or Spanish 
language and in which no priority is claimed, provided that the national Office of 
the interested country sorts out these documents and places them at the disposal 
of each International Searching Authority. 
 
(d)  Where an application is republished once (for example, an 
Offenlegungsschrift as an Auslegeschrift) or more than once, no International 
Searching Authority shall be obliged to keep all versions in its documentation;  
consequently, each such Authority shall be entitled not to keep more than 
one version.  Furthermore, where an application is granted and is issued in the 
 

 
 
 
133 
form of a patent or a utility certificate (France), no International Searching 
Authority shall be obliged to keep both the application and the patent or utility 
certificate (France) in its documentation;  consequently, each such Authority shall 
be entitled to keep either the application only or the patent or utility certificate 
(France) only. 
 
(e)  Any International Searching Authority whose official language, or one of 
whose official languages, is not Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian or Spanish is 
entitled not to include in its documentation those patent documents of the People’s 
Republic of China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the 
former Soviet Union as well as those patent documents in the Spanish language, 
respectively, for which no abstracts in the English language are generally 
available.  English abstracts becoming generally available after the date of entry 
into force of these Regulations shall require the inclusion of the patent documents 
to which the abstracts refer no later than six months after such abstracts become 
generally available.  In case of the interruption of abstracting services in English 
in technical fields in which English abstracts were formerly generally available, 
the Assembly shall take appropriate measures to provide for the prompt 
restoration of such services in the said fields. 
 
(f)  For the purposes of this Rule, applications which have only been laid open 
for public inspection are not considered published applications.

of the international application as filed or of a translation referred to in 
Rule 45bis.1(b)(iii) or 45bis.1(c)(i), taking due account of the international search 
report and the written opinion established under Rule 43bis.1 where they are 
available to the Authority specified for supplementary search before it starts the 
search.  Where the supplementary search request contains an indication under 
Rule 45bis.1(d), the supplementary international search may be restricted to the 
invention specified by the applicant under Rule 45bis.1(d) and those parts of the 
international application which relate to that invention. 
 
(c)  For the purposes of the supplementary international search, Article 17(2) 
and Rules 13ter.1, 33 and 39 shall apply mutatis mutandis.

specified for supplementary search before it starts the search under paragraph (a), 
that Authority may exclude from the supplementary search any claims which were 
not the subject of the international search. 
 
(e)  Where the International Searching Authority has made the declaration 
referred to in Article 17(2)(a) and that declaration is available to the Authority 
 

 
 
 
149

International Bureau accordingly. 
 
(f)  The supplementary international search shall cover at least the 
documentation indicated for that purpose in the applicable agreement under 
Article 16(3)(b). 
 
(g)  If the Authority specified for supplementary search finds that carrying out 
the search is entirely excluded by a limitation or condition referred to in 
Rule 45bis.9(a), other than a limitation under Article 17(2) as applicable by virtue 
of Rule 45bis.5(c), the supplementary search request shall be considered not to

(b)  In considering whether the international application complies with the 
requirement of unity of invention, the Authority shall take due account of any 
documents received by it under Rule 45bis.4(e)(vi) and (vii) before it starts the 
supplementary international search. 
 
(c)  The applicant may, within one month from the date of the notification 
under paragraph (a)(ii), request the Authority to review the opinion referred to in

payment to it, for its own benefit, of a review fee whose amount shall be fixed by 
it. 
 

 
 
 
150 
 
(d)  If the applicant, within the time limit under paragraph (c), requests a 
review of the opinion by the Authority and pays any required review fee, the 
opinion shall be reviewed by the Authority.  The review shall not be carried out 
only by the person who made the decision which is the subject of the review.  
Where the Authority: 
 
(i) finds that the opinion was entirely justified, it shall notify the applicant 
accordingly; 
 
(ii) finds that the opinion was partially unjustified but still considers that 
the international application does not comply with the requirement of unity of 
invention, it shall notify the applicant accordingly and, where necessary, proceed 
as provided for in paragraph (a)(i);

applicant accordingly, establish the supplementary international search report on 
all parts of the international application and refund the review fee to the applicant.

the decision thereon shall be communicated to the designated Offices together 
with the supplementary international search report.  The applicant shall submit 
any translation thereof with the furnishing of the translation of the international 
application required under Article 22.

specified for supplementary search decides to restrict the supplementary 
international search in accordance with the second sentence of Rule 45bis.5(b) or 
with Rule 45bis.5(h), provided that any reference in the said paragraphs to the 
“international application” shall be construed as a reference to those parts of the 
international application which relate to the invention specified by the applicant 
under Rule 45bis.1(d) or which relate to the claims and those parts of the 
international application for which the Authority will carry out a supplementary 
international search, respectively.

and 70.7(a) shall apply as if the supplementary international search report were 
part of the international search report. 
 
(c)  A supplementary international search report need not be taken into 
account by the International Preliminary Examining Authority for the purposes of 
a written opinion or the international preliminary examination report if it is

in Article 22(1) was not compatible with the national law applied by that Office on 
October 3, 2001), and which has not withdrawn that notification under paragraph (3) of those 
decisions, as though the reference in each of Rule 47.1(c) and (e) to “28 months” was a reference 
to “19 months,” with the consequence that two notifications under Rule 47.1(c) shall, if 
applicable, be sent in respect of such an application.

International Bureau shall be indicated. 
 
(g)  If, at the time of the completion of the technical preparations for 
international publication, the international search report is not yet available, the 
front page shall contain an indication to the effect that that report was not available 
 

 
 
 
157 
and that the international search report (when it becomes available) will be 
separately published together with a revised front page. 
 
(h)  If, at the time of the completion of the technical preparations for 
international publication, the time limit for amending the claims under Article 19 
has not expired, the front page shall refer to that fact and indicate that, should the 
claims be amended under Article 19, then, promptly after receipt by the 
International Bureau of such amendments within the time limit under Rule 46.1, 
the full text of the claims as amended will be published together with a revised 
front page.  If a statement under Article 19(1) has been filed, that statement shall 
be published as well, unless the International Bureau finds that the statement does 
not comply with the provisions of Rule 46.4. 
 
(i)  If the authorization by the receiving Office, the International Searching 
Authority or the International Bureau of a rectification of an obvious mistake in 
the international application under Rule 91.1 is received by or, where applicable,

international publication, the request for rectification, any reasons and any 
comments referred to in that Rule shall be promptly published after the receipt of 
such request for publication, and the front page shall be republished. 
 
(l)  The International Bureau shall, upon a reasoned request by the applicant 
received by the International Bureau prior to the completion of the technical 
preparations for international publication, omit from publication any information, 
if it finds that: 
 
(i) this information does not obviously serve the purpose of informing the 
public about the international application; 
 
(ii) publication of such information would clearly prejudice the personal or 
economic interests of any person;  and 
 
(iii) there is no prevailing public interest to have access to that information. 
 

 
 
 
158 
Rule 26.4 shall apply mutatis mutandis as to the manner in which the applicant 
shall present the information which is the subject of a request made under this 
paragraph. 
 
(m)  Where the receiving Office, the International Searching Authority, the 
Authority specified for supplementary search or the International Bureau notes 
any information meeting the criteria set out under paragraph (l), that Office, 
Authority or Bureau may suggest to the applicant to request the omission from 
international publication in accordance with paragraph (l). 
 
(n)  Where the International Bureau has omitted information from 
international publication in accordance with paragraph (l) and that information is 
also contained in the file of the international application held by the receiving

supplementary search or the International Preliminary Examining Authority, the 
International Bureau shall promptly notify that Office and Authority accordingly. 
48.3   Languages of Publication

and a translation into a language of publication has been furnished under 
Rule 12.3 or 12.4, that application shall be published in the language of that 
translation.

English, the international search report to the extent that it is published under 
Rule 48.2(a)(v), or the declaration referred to in Article 17(2)(a), the title of the 
invention, the abstract and any text matter pertaining to the figure or figures

Copy, Translation and Fee under Article 22 
49.1   Notification 
 
(a)  Any Contracting State requiring the furnishing of a translation or the 
payment of a national fee, or both, under Article 22, shall notify the International 
Bureau of: 
 
(i) the languages from which and the language into which it requires 
translation, 
 
(ii) the amount of the national fee. 
 
(a-bis)  Any Contracting State not requiring the furnishing, under Article 22, 
by the applicant of a copy of the international application (even though the 
communication of the copy of the international application by the International 
Bureau under Rule 47 has not taken place by the expiration of the time limit 
applicable under Article 22) shall notify the International Bureau accordingly. 
 
(a-ter)  Any Contracting State which, pursuant to Article 24(2), maintains, if 
it is a designated State, the effect provided for in Article 11(3) even though a copy 
of the international application is not furnished by the applicant by the expiration 
of the time limit applicable under Article 22 shall notify the International Bureau 
accordingly. 
 

 
 
 
160 
 
(b)  Any notification received by the International Bureau under 
paragraphs (a), (a-bis) or (a-ter) shall be promptly published by the International 
Bureau in the Gazette. 
 
(c)  If the requirements under paragraph (a) change later, such changes shall 
be notified by the Contracting State to the International Bureau and that Bureau 
shall promptly publish the notification in the Gazette.  If the change means that 
translation is required into a language which, before the change, was not required, 
such change shall be effective only with respect to international applications filed 
later than two months after the publication of the notification in the Gazette.  
Otherwise, the effective date of any change shall be determined by the Contracting 
State. 
49.2   Languages 
 
The language into which translation may be required must be an official 
language of the designated Office.  If there are several of such languages, no 
translation may be required if the international application is in one of them.  If 
there are several official languages and a translation must be furnished, the 
applicant may choose any of those languages.  Notwithstanding the foregoing 
provisions of this paragraph, if there are several official languages but the national 
law prescribes the use of one such language for foreigners, a translation into that 
language may be required. 
49.3   Statements under Article 19;  Indications under Rule 13bis.4 
 
For the purposes of Article 22 and the present Rule, any statement made under 
Article 19(1) and any indication furnished under Rule 13bis.4 shall, subject to 
Rule 49.5(c) and (h), be considered part of the international application. 
49.4   Use of National Form 
 
No applicant shall be required to use a national form when performing the 
acts referred to in Article 22. 
49.5   Contents of and Physical Requirements for the Translation 
 
(a)  For the purposes of Article 22, the translation of the international 
application shall contain the description (subject to paragraph (a-bis)), the claims, 
any text matter of the drawings and the abstract.  If required by the designated 
Office, the translation shall also, subject to paragraphs (b), (c-bis) and (e), 
 
(i) contain the request, 
 
(ii) if the claims have been amended under Article 19, contain both the 
claims as filed and the claims as amended (the claims as amended shall be 
furnished in the form of a translation of the complete set of claims furnished under 
Rule 46.5(a) in replacement of all the claims originally filed), and 
 

 
 
 
161 
 
(iii) be accompanied by a copy of the drawings. 
 
(a-bis)  No designated Office shall require the applicant to furnish to it a 
translation of any text matter contained in the sequence listing part of the 
description if such sequence listing part complies with Rule 12.1(d) and includes 
the language-dependent free text in a language which the designated Office 
accepts for the purpose, save that a designated Office which supplies published 
sequence listings to database providers may require a translation of the sequence 
listing part of the description into English, in accordance with the Administrative 
Instructions, where the language-dependent free text is not included in English. 
 
(b)  Any designated Office requiring the furnishing of a translation of the 
request shall furnish copies of the request form in the language of the translation 
free of charge to the applicants.  The form and contents of the request form in the 
language of the translation shall not be different from those of the request under 
Rules 3 and 4;  in particular, the request form in the language of the translation 
shall not ask for any information that is not in the request as filed.  The use of the 
request form in the language of the translation shall be optional. 
 
(c)  Where the applicant did not furnish a translation of any statement made 
under Article 19(1), the designated Office may disregard such statement. 
 
(c-bis)  Where the applicant furnishes, to a designated Office which requires 
under paragraph (a)(ii) a translation of both the claims as filed and the claims as 
amended, only one of the required two translations, the designated Office may 
disregard the claims of which a translation has not been furnished or invite the 
applicant to furnish the missing translation within a time limit which shall be 
reasonable under the circumstances and shall be fixed in the invitation.  Where 
the designated Office chooses to invite the applicant to furnish the missing 
translation and the latter is not furnished within the time limit fixed in the 
invitation, the designated Office may disregard those claims of which a translation 
has not been furnished or consider the international application withdrawn. 
 
(d)  If any drawing contains text matter, the translation of that text matter shall 
be furnished either in the form of a copy of the original drawing with the 
translation pasted on the original text matter or in the form of a drawing executed 
anew. 
 
(e)  Any designated Office requiring under paragraph (a) the furnishing of a 
copy of the drawings shall, where the applicant failed to furnish such copy within 
the time limit applicable under Article 22, invite the applicant to furnish such copy 
within a time limit which shall be reasonable under the circumstances and shall 
be fixed in the invitation. 
 
(f)  The expression “Fig.” does not require translation into any language. 
 

 
 
 
162 
 
(g)  Where any copy of the drawings or any drawing executed anew which 
has been furnished under paragraph (d) or (e) does not comply with the physical 
requirements referred to in Rule 11, the designated Office may invite the applicant 
to correct the defect within a time limit which shall be reasonable under the 
circumstances and shall be fixed in the invitation. 
 
(h)  Where the applicant did not furnish a translation of the abstract or of any 
indication furnished under Rule 13bis.4, the designated Office shall invite the 
applicant to furnish such translation, if it deems it to be necessary, within a time 
limit which shall be reasonable under the circumstances and shall be fixed in the 
invitation. 
 
(i)  Information on any requirement and practice of designated Offices under 
the second sentence of paragraph (a) shall be published by the International 
Bureau in the Gazette. 
 
(j)  No designated Office shall require that the translation of the international 
application comply with physical requirements other than those prescribed for the 
international application as filed. 
 
(k)  Where a title has been established by the International Searching 
Authority pursuant to Rule 37.2, the translation shall contain the title as 
established by that Authority. 
 
(l)  If, on July 12, 1991, paragraph (c-bis) or paragraph (k) is not compatible 
with the national law applied by the designated Office, the paragraph concerned 
shall not apply to that designated Office for as long as it continues not to be 
compatible with that law, provided that the said Office informs the International 
Bureau accordingly by December 31, 1991.  The information received shall be 
promptly published by the International Bureau in the Gazette.9

49.6   Reinstatement of Rights after Failure to Perform the Acts Referred to in 
Article 2210 
 
(a)  Where the effect of the international application provided for in 
Article 11(3) has ceased because the applicant failed to perform the acts referred 
to in Article 22 within the applicable time limit, the designated Office shall, upon 
request of the applicant, and subject to paragraphs (b) to (e) of this Rule, reinstate 
the rights of the applicant with respect to that international application if it finds 
that any delay in meeting that time limit was unintentional or, at the option of the 
designated Office, that the failure to meet that time limit occurred in spite of due 
care required by the circumstances having been taken. 
 
(b)  The request under paragraph (a) shall be submitted to the designated 
Office, and the acts referred to in Article 22 shall be performed, within whichever 
of the following periods expires first: 
 
(i) two months from the date of removal of the cause of the failure to meet 
the applicable time limit under Article 22;  or 
 
(ii) 12 months from the date of the expiration of the applicable time limit 
under Article 22; 
provided that the applicant may submit the request at any later time if so permitted 
by the national law applicable by the designated Office. 
 
(c)  The request under paragraph (a) shall state the reasons for the failure to 
comply with the applicable time limit under Article 22.

(ii) that a declaration or other evidence in support of the reasons referred 
to in paragraph (c) be filed. 
 
10  Editor’s Note:  Paragraphs (a) to (e) of Rule 49.6 do not apply to any international 
application whose international filing date is before January 1, 2003, provided that: 
 
(i) those paragraphs shall, subject to item (iii), apply to any international application whose 
international filing date is before January 1, 2003, and in respect of which the applicable time 
limit under Article 22 expires on or after January 1, 2003; 
 
(ii) to the extent that those paragraphs are applicable by virtue of Rule 76.5, the latter Rule 
shall, subject to item (iii), apply to any international application whose international filing date 
is before January 1, 2003, and in respect of which the applicable time limit under Article 39(1) 
expires on or after January 1, 2003; 
 (iii) where a designated Office has informed the International Bureau under paragraph (f) of 
Rule 49.6 that paragraphs (a) to (e) of that Rule are not compatible with the national law applied 
by that Office, items (i) and (ii) of this paragraph shall apply in respect of that Office except 
that each reference in those items to the date January 1, 2003, shall be read as a reference to the 
date of entry into force of Rule 49.6(a) to (e) in respect of that Office. 
Information received by the International Bureau concerning any such incompatibility is published in 
the Gazette and on the WIPO website at:  www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/reservations/res_incomp.html.  
 

 
 
 
164 
 
(e)  The designated Office shall not refuse a request under paragraph (a) 
without giving the applicant the opportunity to make observations on the intended 
refusal within a time limit which shall be reasonable under the circumstances. 
 
(f)  If, on October 1, 2002, paragraphs (a) to (e) are not compatible with the 
national law applied by the designated Office, those paragraphs shall not apply in 
respect of that designated Office for as long as they continue not to be compatible 
with that law, provided that the said Office informs the International Bureau 
accordingly by January 1, 2003.  The information received shall be promptly 
published by the International Bureau in the Gazette.11 
Rule 49bis  
Indications as to Protection Sought  
for Purposes of National Processing 
49bis.1   Choice of Certain Kinds of Protection 
 
(a)  If the applicant wishes the international application to be treated, in a 
designated State in respect of which Article 43 applies, as an application not for 
the grant of a patent but for the grant of another kind of protection referred to in 
that Article, the applicant, when performing the acts referred to in Article 22, shall 
so indicate to the designated Office. 
 
(b)  If the applicant wishes the international application to be treated, in a 
designated State in respect of which Article 44 applies, as an application for the 
grant of more than one kind of protection referred to in Article 43, the applicant, 
when performing the acts referred to in Article 22, shall so indicate to the 
designated Office and shall indicate, if applicable, which kind of protection is 
sought primarily and which kind is sought subsidiarily. 
 
(c)  In the cases referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b), if the applicant wishes 
the international application to be treated, in a designated State, as an application 
for a patent of addition, certificate of addition, inventor’s certificate of addition or 
utility certificate of addition, the applicant, when performing the acts referred to 
in Article 22, shall indicate the relevant parent application, parent patent or other 
parent grant. 
 
(d)  If the applicant wishes the international application to be treated, in a 
designated State, as an application for a continuation or a continuation-in-part of 
an earlier application, the applicant, when performing the acts referred to in

165 
 
(e)  Where no express indication under paragraph (a) is made by the applicant 
when performing the acts referred to in Article 22 but the national fee referred to 
in Article 22 paid by the applicant corresponds to the national fee for a particular 
kind of protection, the payment of that fee shall be considered to be an indication 
of the wish of the applicant that the international application is to be treated as an 
application for that kind of protection and the designated Office shall inform the 
applicant accordingly. 
49bis.2   Time of Furnishing Indications  
 
(a)  No designated Office shall require the applicant to furnish, before 
performing the acts referred to in Article 22, any indication referred to in

Restoration of Right of Priority by Designated Office 
49ter.1   Effect of Restoration of Right of Priority by Receiving Office 
 
(a)  Where the receiving Office has restored a right of priority under 
Rule 26bis.3 based on a finding by it that the failure to file the international 
application within the priority period occurred in spite of due care required by the 
circumstances having been taken, that restoration shall, subject to paragraph (c), 
be effective in each designated State. 
 
(b)  Where the receiving Office has restored a right of priority under 
Rule 26bis.3 based on a finding by it that the failure to file the international 
application within the priority period was unintentional, that restoration shall, 
subject to paragraph (c), be effective in any designated State whose applicable 
national law provides for restoration of the right of priority based on that criterion 
or on a criterion which, from the viewpoint of applicants, is more favorable than 
that criterion. 
 
(c)  A decision by the receiving Office to restore a right of priority under 
Rule 26bis.3 shall not be effective in a designated State where the designated 
Office, a court or any other competent organ of or acting for that designated State 
finds that a requirement under Rule 26bis.3(a), (b)(i) or (c) was not complied with, 
taking into account the reasons stated in the request submitted to the receiving 
Office under Rule 26bis.3(a) and any declaration or other evidence filed with the 
receiving Office under Rule 26bis.3(b)(iii). 
 

 
 
 
166 
 
(d)  A designated Office shall not review the decision of the receiving Office 
unless it may reasonably doubt that a requirement referred to in paragraph (c) was 
complied with, in which case the designated Office shall notify the applicant 
accordingly, indicating the reasons for that doubt and giving the applicant an 
opportunity to make observations within a reasonable time limit. 
 
(e)  No designated State shall be bound by a decision of the receiving Office 
refusing a request under Rule 26bis.3 for restoration of the right of priority. 
 
(f)  Where the receiving Office has refused a request for the restoration of the 
right of priority, any designated Office may consider that request to be a request 
for restoration submitted to that designated Office under Rule 49ter.2(a) within 
the time limit under that Rule. 
 
(g)  If, on October 5, 2005, paragraphs (a) to (d) are not compatible with the 
national law applied by the designated Office, those paragraphs shall not apply in 
respect of that Office for as long as they continue not to be compatible with that 
law, provided that the said Office informs the International Bureau accordingly 
by April 5, 2006.  The information received shall be promptly published by the 
International Bureau in the Gazette.12 
49ter.2   Restoration of Right of Priority by Designated Office 
 
(a)  Where the international application claims the priority of an earlier 
application and has an international filing date which is later than the date on 
which the priority period expired but within the period of two months from that 
date, the designated Office shall, on the request of the applicant in accordance 
with paragraph (b), restore the right of priority if the Office finds that a criterion 
applied by it (“criterion for restoration”) is satisfied, namely, that the failure to 
file the international application within the priority period: 
 
(i) occurred in spite of due care required by the circumstances having been 
taken;  or 
 
(ii) was unintentional. 
Each designated Office shall apply at least one of those criteria and may apply 
both of them. 
 
(b)  A request under paragraph (a) shall: 
 
(i) be filed with the designated Office within a time limit of one month 
from the applicable time limit under Article 22 or, where the applicant makes an 
express request to the designated Office under Article 23(2), within a time limit 
of one month from the date of receipt of that request by the designated Office;

(ii) state the reasons for the failure to file the international application 
within the priority period and preferably be accompanied by any declaration or 
other evidence required under paragraph (c);  and 
 
(iii) be accompanied by any fee for requesting restoration required under 
paragraph (d). 
 
(c)  The designated Office may require that a declaration or other evidence in 
support of the statement of reasons referred to in paragraph (b)(ii) be filed with it 
within a time limit which shall be reasonable under the circumstances.

designated Office to the payment to it, for its own benefit, of a fee for requesting 
restoration. 
 
(e)  The designated Office shall not refuse, totally or in part, a request under 
paragraph (a) without giving the applicant the opportunity to make observations 
on the intended refusal within a time limit which shall be reasonable under the 
circumstances.  Such notice of intended refusal may be sent by the designated 
Office to the applicant together with any invitation to file a declaration or other 
evidence under paragraph (c). 
 
(f)  Where the national law applicable by the designated Office provides, in 
respect of the restoration of the right of priority, for requirements which, from the 
viewpoint of applicants, are more favorable than the requirements provided for 
under paragraphs (a) and (b), the designated Office may, when determining the 
right of priority, apply the requirements under the applicable national law instead 
of the requirements under those paragraphs. 
 
(g)  Each designated Office shall inform the International Bureau of which of 
the criteria for restoration it applies, of the requirements, where applicable, of the 
national law applicable in accordance with paragraph (f), and of any subsequent 
changes in that respect.  The International Bureau shall promptly publish such 
information in the Gazette. 
 
(h)  If, on October 5, 2005, paragraphs (a) to (g) are not compatible with the 
national law applied by the designated Office, those paragraphs shall not apply in 
respect of that Office for as long as they continue not to be compatible with that 
law, provided that the said Office informs the International Bureau accordingly 
by April 5, 2006.  The information received shall be promptly published by the

Rule 64   
Prior Art for International Preliminary Examination 
64.1   Prior Art 
 
(a)  For the purposes of Article 33(2) and (3), everything made available to 
the public anywhere in the world by means of written disclosure (including 
drawings and other illustrations) shall be considered prior art provided that such 
making available occurred prior to the relevant date. 
 
(b)  For the purposes of paragraph (a), the relevant date shall be: 
 
(i) subject to items (ii) and (iii), the international filing date of the 
international application under international preliminary examination; 
 
(ii) where the international application under international preliminary 
examination claims the priority of an earlier application and has an international 
filing date which is within the priority period, the filing date of such earlier 
application, unless the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers 
that the priority claim is not valid; 
 
(iii) where the international application under international preliminary 
examination claims the priority of an earlier application and has an international 
filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired but 
within the period of two months from that date, the filing date of such earlier 
application, unless the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers 
that the priority claim is not valid for reasons other than the fact that the 
international application has an international filing date which is later than the 
date on which the priority period expired. 
64.2   Non-Written Disclosures 
 
In cases where the making available to the public occurred by means of an 
oral disclosure, use, exhibition or other non-written means (“non-written 
disclosure”) before the relevant date as defined in Rule 64.1(b) and the date of 
such non-written disclosure is indicated in a written disclosure which has been 
made available to the public on a date which is the same as, or later than, the 
relevant date, the non-written disclosure shall not be considered part of the prior 
art for the purposes of Article 33(2) and (3).  Nevertheless, the international 
preliminary examination report shall call attention to such non-written disclosure 
in the manner provided for in Rule 70.9. 
64.3   Certain Published Documents 
 
In cases where any application or any patent which would constitute prior art 
for the purposes of Article 33(2) and (3) had it been published prior to the relevant 
date referred to in Rule 64.1 was published on a date which is the same as, or later 
than, the relevant date but was filed earlier than the relevant date or claimed the 
 

 
 
 
187 
priority of an earlier application which had been filed prior to the relevant date, 
such published application or patent shall not be considered part of the prior art 
for the purposes of Article 33(2) and (3).  Nevertheless, the international 
preliminary examination report shall call attention to such application or patent in 
the manner provided for in Rule 70.10. 
Rule 65  
Inventive Step or Non-Obviousness 
65.1   Approach to Prior Art 
 
For the purposes of Article 33(3), the international preliminary examination 
shall take into consideration the relation of any particular claim to the prior art as 
a whole.  It shall take into consideration the claim’s relation not only to individual 
documents or parts thereof taken separately but also its relation to combinations 
of such documents or parts of documents, where such combinations are obvious 
to a person skilled in the art. 
65.2   Relevant Date 
 
For the purposes of Article 33(3), the relevant date for the consideration of 
inventive step (non-obviousness) is the date prescribed in Rule 64.1. 
Rule 66  
Procedure before the  
International Preliminary Examining Authority

shall be based on the international application as filed. 
 
(b)  The applicant may submit amendments under Article 34 at the time of 
filing the demand or, subject to Rule 66.4bis, until the international preliminary 
examination report is established. 
 
(c)  Any amendments under Article 19 made before the demand was filed 
shall be taken into account for the purposes of the international preliminary 
examination unless superseded, or considered as reversed, by an amendment 
under Article 34. 
 
(d)  Any amendments under Article 19 made after the demand was filed and 
any amendments under Article 34 submitted to the International Preliminary 
Examining Authority shall, subject to Rule 66.4bis, be taken into account for the 
purposes of the international preliminary examination. 
 
(d-bis)  A rectification of an obvious mistake that is authorized under 
Rule 91.1 shall, subject to Rule 66.4bis, be taken into account by the International 
 

 
 
 
188 
Preliminary Examining Authority for the purposes of the international 
preliminary examination. 
 
(e)  Claims relating to inventions in respect of which no international search 
report has been established need not be the subject of international preliminary 
examination. 
66.1bis   Written Opinion of the International Searching Authority 
 
(a)  Subject to paragraph (b), the written opinion established by the 
International Searching Authority under Rule 43bis.1 shall be considered to be a 
written opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority for the 
purposes of Rule 66.2(a). 
 
(b)  An International Preliminary Examining Authority may notify the 
International Bureau that paragraph (a) shall not apply to the procedure before it 
in respect of written opinions established under Rule 43bis.1 by the International 
Searching Authority or Authorities specified in the notification, provided that 
such a notification shall not apply to cases where the national Office or 
intergovernmental organization that acted as International Searching Authority is 
also acting as International Preliminary Examining Authority.  The International 
Bureau shall promptly publish any such notification in the Gazette.15 
 
(c)  Where the written opinion established by the International Searching 
Authority under Rule 43bis.1 is not, by virtue of a notification under 
paragraph (b), considered to be a written opinion of the International Preliminary 
Examining Authority for the purposes of Rule 66.2(a), the International 
Preliminary Examining Authority shall notify the applicant accordingly in 
writing. 
 
(d)  A written opinion established by the International Searching Authority 
under Rule 43bis.1 which is not, by virtue of a notification under paragraph (b), 
considered to be a written opinion of the International Preliminary Examining 
Authority for the purposes of Rule 66.2(a) shall nevertheless be taken into account 
by the International Preliminary Examining Authority in proceeding under 
Rule 66.2(a). 
66.1ter   Top-up Searches 
 
The International Preliminary Examining Authority shall conduct a search 
(“top-up search”) to discover documents referred to in Rule 64 which have been 
published or have become available to the said Authority for search subsequent 
to the date on which the international search report was established, unless it 
considers that such a search would serve no useful purpose.  If the Authority finds 
 
15  Editor’s Note:  This information is also published on the WIPO website at:  
www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/reservations/res_incomp.html.  
 

 
 
 
189 
that any of the situations referred to in Article 34(3) or (4) or Rule 66.1(e) exists, 
the top-up search shall cover only those parts of the international application that 
are the subject of international preliminary examination. 
66.2   Written Opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority 
 
(a)  If the International Preliminary Examining Authority 
 
(i) considers that any of the situations referred to in Article 34(4) exists, 
 
(ii) considers that the international preliminary examination report should 
be negative in respect of any of the claims because the invention claimed therein 
does not appear to be novel, does not appear to involve an inventive step (does 
not appear to be non-obvious), or does not appear to be industrially applicable, 
 
(iii) notices that there is some defect in the form or contents of the 
international application under the Treaty or these Regulations, 
 
(iv) considers that any amendment goes beyond the disclosure in the 
international application as filed, 
 
(v) wishes to accompany the international preliminary examination report 
by observations on the clarity of the claims, the description, and the drawings, or 
the question whether the claims are fully supported by the description, 
 
(vi) considers that a claim relates to an invention in respect of which no 
international search report has been established and has decided not to carry out 
the international preliminary examination in respect of that claim, or 
 
(vii) considers that a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence listing is not 
available to it in such a form that a meaningful international preliminary 
examination can be carried out, 
the said Authority shall notify the applicant accordingly in writing.  Where the 
national law of the national Office acting as International Preliminary Examining 
Authority does not allow multiple dependent claims to be drafted in a manner 
different from that provided for in the second and third sentences of Rule 6.4(a), 
the International Preliminary Examining Authority may, in case of failure to use 
that manner of claiming, apply Article 34(4)(b).  In such case, it shall notify the 
applicant accordingly in writing. 
 
(b)  The notification shall fully state the reasons for the opinion of the 
International Preliminary Examining Authority. 
 
(c)  The notification shall invite the applicant to submit a written reply 
together, where appropriate, with amendments. 
 
(d)  The notification shall fix a time limit for the reply.  The time limit shall 
be reasonable under the circumstances.  It shall normally be two months after the 
date of notification.  In no case shall it be shorter than one month after the said 
date.  It shall be at least two months after the said date where the international 
 

 
 
 
190 
search report is transmitted at the same time as the notification.  It shall, subject 
to paragraph (e), not be more than three months after the said date. 
 
(e)  The time limit for replying to the notification may be extended if the 
applicant so requests before its expiration. 
66.3   Formal Response to the International Preliminary Examining Authority 
 
(a)  The applicant may respond to the invitation referred to in Rule 66.2(c) of 
the International Preliminary Examining Authority by making amendments or – 
if he disagrees with the opinion of that Authority – by submitting arguments, as 
the case may be, or do both. 
 
(b)  Any response shall be submitted directly to the International Preliminary 
Examining Authority. 
66.4   Additional Opportunity for Submitting Amendments or Arguments 
 
(a)  If the International Preliminary Examining Authority wishes to issue one 
or more additional written opinions, it may do so, and Rules 66.2 and 66.3 shall 
apply. 
 
(b)  On the request of the applicant, the International Preliminary Examining 
Authority may give him one or more additional opportunities to submit 
amendments or arguments. 
66.4bis   Consideration of Amendments, Arguments and Rectifications of Obvious 
Mistakes 
 
Amendments, arguments and rectifications of obvious mistakes need not be 
taken into account by the International Preliminary Examining Authority for the 
purposes of a written opinion or the international preliminary examination report 
if they are received by, authorized by or notified to that Authority, as applicable, 
after it has begun to draw up that opinion or report. 
66.5   Amendment 
 
Any change, other than the rectification of an obvious mistake, in the claims, 
the description, or the drawings, including cancellation of claims, omission of 
passages in the description, or omission of certain drawings, shall be considered 
an amendment. 
66.6   Informal Communications with the Applicant 
 
The International Preliminary Examining Authority may, at any time, 
communicate informally, over the telephone, in writing, or through personal 
interviews, with the applicant.  The said Authority shall, at its discretion, decide 
whether it wishes to grant more than one personal interview if so requested by the 
applicant, or whether it wishes to reply to any informal written communication 
from the applicant. 
 

 
 
 
191 
66.7   Copy and Translation of Earlier Application Whose Priority Is Claimed 
 
(a)  If the International Preliminary Examining Authority needs a copy of the 
earlier application whose priority is claimed in the international application, the 
International Bureau shall, on request, promptly furnish such copy.  If that copy 
is not furnished to the International Preliminary Examining Authority because the 
applicant failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 17.1, and if that earlier 
application was not filed with that Authority in its capacity as a national Office or 
the priority document is not available to that Authority from a digital library in 
accordance with the Administrative Instructions, the international preliminary 
examination report may be established as if the priority had not been claimed. 
 
(b)  If the application whose priority is claimed in the international application 
is in a language other than the language or one of the languages of the 
International Preliminary Examining Authority, that Authority may, where the 
validity of the priority claim is relevant for the formulation of the opinion referred 
to in Article 33(1), invite the applicant to furnish a translation in the said language 
or one of the said languages within two months from the date of the invitation.  If 
the translation is not furnished within that time limit, the international preliminary 
examination report may be established as if the priority had not been claimed. 
66.8   Form of Amendments 
 
(a)  Subject to paragraph (b), when amending the description or the drawings, 
the applicant shall be required to submit a replacement sheet for every sheet of 
the international application which, on account of an amendment, differs from the 
sheet previously filed.  The replacement sheet or sheets shall be accompanied by 
a letter which shall draw attention to the differences between the replaced sheets 
and the replacement sheets, shall indicate the basis for the amendment in the 
application as filed and shall preferably also explain the reasons for the 
amendment. 
 
(b)  Where the amendment consists in the deletion of passages or in minor 
alterations or additions, the replacement sheet referred to in paragraph (a) may be 
a copy of the relevant sheet of the international application containing the 
alterations or additions, provided that the clarity and direct reproducibility of that 
sheet are not adversely affected.  To the extent that any amendment results in the 
cancellation of an entire sheet, that amendment shall be communicated in a letter 
which shall preferably also explain the reasons for the amendment. 
 
(c)  When amending the claims, Rule 46.5 shall apply mutatis mutandis.  The 
set of claims submitted under Rule 46.5 as applicable by virtue of this paragraph 
shall replace all the claims originally filed or previously amended under 
Articles 19 or 34, as the case may be.

examination concerning such programs. 
Rule 68  
Lack of Unity of Invention  
(International Preliminary Examination) 
68.1   No Invitation to Restrict or Pay 
 
Where the International Preliminary Examining Authority finds that the 
requirement of unity of invention is not complied with and chooses not to invite 
the applicant to restrict the claims or to pay additional fees, it shall proceed with 
the international preliminary examination, subject to Article 34(4)(b) and 
Rule 66.1(e), in respect of the entire international application, but shall indicate, 
in any written opinion and in the international preliminary examination report, 
that it considers that the requirement of unity of invention is not fulfilled and it 
shall specify the reasons therefor. 
68.2   Invitation to Restrict or Pay 
 
Where the International Preliminary Examining Authority finds that the 
requirement of unity of invention is not complied with and chooses to invite the 
applicant, at his option, to restrict the claims or to pay additional fees, the 
invitation shall: 
 

 
 
 
193 
 
(i) specify at least one possibility of restriction which, in the opinion of 
the International Preliminary Examining Authority, would be in compliance with 
the applicable requirement; 
 
(ii) specify the reasons for which the international application is not 
considered as complying with the requirement of unity of invention; 
 
(iii) invite the applicant to comply with the invitation within one month 
from the date of the invitation; 
 
(iv) indicate the amount of the required additional fees to be paid in case 
the applicant so chooses;  and 
 
(v) invite the applicant to pay, where applicable, the protest fee referred to 
in Rule 68.3(e) within one month from the date of the invitation, and indicate the 
amount to be paid. 
68.3   Additional Fees 
 
(a)  The amount of the additional fees due for international preliminary 
examination under Article 34(3)(a) shall be determined by the competent 
International Preliminary Examining Authority. 
 
(b)  The additional fees due for international preliminary examination under 
Article 34(3)(a) shall be payable direct to the International Preliminary 
Examining Authority. 
 
(c)  Any applicant may pay the additional fees under protest, that is, 
accompanied by a reasoned statement to the effect that the international 
application complies with the requirement of unity of invention or that the amount 
of the required additional fees is excessive.  Such protest shall be examined by a 
review body constituted in the framework of the International Preliminary 
Examining Authority which, to the extent that it finds the protest justified, shall 
order the total or partial reimbursement to the applicant of the additional fees.  On 
the request of the applicant, the text of both the protest and the decision thereon 
shall be notified to the elected Offices as an annex to the international preliminary 
examination report. 
 
(d)  The membership of the review body referred to in paragraph (c) may 
include, but shall not be limited to, the person who made the decision which is the 
subject of the protest. 
 
(e)  The examination of a protest referred to in paragraph (c) may be subjected 
by the International Preliminary Examining Authority to the payment to it, for its 
own benefit, of a protest fee.  Where the applicant has not, within the time limit 
under Rule 68.2(v), paid any required protest fee, the protest shall be considered 
not to have been made and the International Preliminary Examining Authority 
shall so declare.  The protest fee shall be refunded to the applicant where the 
 

 
 
 
194 
review body referred to in paragraph (c) finds that the protest was entirely 
justified. 
68.4   Procedure in the Case of Insufficient Restriction of the Claims 
 
If the applicant restricts the claims but not sufficiently to comply with the 
requirement of unity of invention, the International Preliminary Examining 
Authority shall proceed as provided in Article 34(3)(c). 
68.5   Main Invention 
 
In case of doubt which invention is the main invention for the purposes of 
Article 34(3)(c), the invention first mentioned in the claims shall be considered 
the main invention. 
Rule 69  
Start of and Time Limit for  
International Preliminary Examination 
69.1   Start of International Preliminary Examination

possession of all of the following: 
 
(i) the demand; 
 
(ii) the amount due (in full) for the handling fee and the preliminary 
examination fee, including, where applicable, the late payment fee under 
Rule 58bis.2;  and 
 
(iii) either the international search report or the declaration by the 
International Searching Authority under Article 17(2)(a) that no international 
search report will be established, and the written opinion established under 
Rule 43bis.1; 
unless the applicant expressly requests to postpone the start of the international 
preliminary examination until the expiration of the applicable time limit under 
Rule 54bis.1(a).

International Searching Authority also acts as International Preliminary 
Examining Authority, the international preliminary examination may, if that 
national Office or intergovernmental organization so wishes and subject to 
paragraphs (d) and (e), start at the same time as the international search. 
 
(b-bis)  Where, in accordance with paragraph (b), the national Office or 
intergovernmental organization that acts as both International Searching 
Authority and International Preliminary Examining Authority wishes to start the 
international preliminary examination at the same time as the international search 
 

 
 
 
195 
and considers that all of the conditions referred to in Article 34(2)(c)(i) to (iii) are 
fulfilled, that national Office or intergovernmental organization need not, in its 
capacity as International Searching Authority, establish a written opinion under

(International Preliminary Examination Report) 
70.1   Definition 
 
For the purposes of this Rule, “report” shall mean international preliminary 
examination report. 
70.2   Basis of the Report 
 
(a)  If the claims have been amended, the report shall issue on the claims as 
amended. 
 
(b)  If, pursuant to Rule 66.7(a) or (b), the report is established as if the 
priority had not been claimed, the report shall so indicate. 
 
(c)  If the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers that any 
amendment goes beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed, 
the report shall be established as if such amendment had not been made, and the 
report shall so indicate.  It shall also indicate the reasons why it considers that the 
amendment goes beyond the said disclosure. 
 
(c-bis)  If the claims, description or drawings have been amended but the 
replacement sheet or sheets were not accompanied by a letter indicating the basis 
for the amendment in the application as filed, as required under Rule 46.5(b)(iii), 
Rule 46.5(b)(iii) being applicable by virtue of Rule 66.8(c), or Rule 66.8(a), as 
applicable, the report may be established as if the amendment had not been made, 
in which case the report shall so indicate. 
 
(d)  Where claims relate to inventions in respect of which no international 
search report has been established and have therefore not been the subject of 
international preliminary examination, the international preliminary examination 
report shall so indicate. 
 
(e)  If a rectification of an obvious mistake is taken into account under 
Rule 66.1, the report shall so indicate.  If a rectification of an obvious mistake is 
not taken into account pursuant to Rule 66.4bis, the report shall, if possible, so 
indicate, failing which the International Preliminary Examining Authority shall 
notify the International Bureau accordingly and the International Bureau shall 
proceed as provided for in the Administrative Instructions.

Rule 66.1ter was made, or else state that no top-up search was made. 
 

 
 
 
197 
70.3   Identifications 
 
The report shall identify the International Preliminary Examining Authority 
which established it by indicating the name of such Authority, and the

the reason for citing any document is easy to imagine on the basis of consultation 
of the cited document; 
 
(iii) generally, explanations shall be given if the case provided for in the

(a)  An obvious mistake in the international application or another document 
submitted by the applicant may be rectified in accordance with this Rule if the 
applicant so requests.

(i) in the case of a mistake in the request part of the international 
application or in a correction thereof – by the receiving Office; 
 
(ii) in the case of a mistake in the description, claims or drawings or in a 
correction thereof, unless the International Preliminary Examining Authority is 
competent under item (iii) – by the International Searching Authority; 
 
(iii) in the case of a mistake in the description, claims or drawings or in a 
correction thereof, or in an amendment under Article 19 or 34, where a demand 
for international preliminary examination has been made and has not been 
withdrawn and the date on which international preliminary examination shall start 
in accordance with Rule 69.1 has passed – by the International Preliminary 
Examining Authority; 
 
(iv) in the case of a mistake in a document not referred to in items (i) to (iii) 
submitted to the receiving Office, the International Searching Authority, the 
International Preliminary Examining Authority or the International Bureau, other 
than a mistake in the abstract or in an amendment under Article 19 – by that 
Office, Authority or Bureau, as the case may be. 
 
(c)  The competent authority shall authorize the rectification under this Rule 
of a mistake if, and only if, it is obvious to the competent authority that, as at the 
applicable date under paragraph (f), something else was intended than what 
appears in the document concerned and that nothing else could have been intended 
than the proposed rectification. 
 
(d)  In the case of a mistake in the description, claims or drawings or in a 
correction or amendment thereof, the competent authority shall, for the purposes 
of paragraph (c), only take into account the contents of the description, claims and 
drawings and, where applicable, the correction or amendment concerned. 
 
(e)  In the case of a mistake in the request part of the international application 
or a correction thereof, or in a document referred to in paragraph (b)(iv), the 
competent authority shall, for the purposes of paragraph (c), only take into 
account the contents of the international application itself and, where applicable,

together with any other document submitted with the request, correction or 
document, as the case may be, any priority document in respect of the 
international application that is available to the authority in accordance with the 
Administrative Instructions, and any other document contained in the authority’s 
international application file at the applicable date under paragraph (f). 
 
(f)  The applicable date for the purposes of paragraphs (c) and (e) shall be: 
 
(i) in the case of a mistake in a part of the international application as filed 
– the international filing date; 
 
(ii) in the case of a mistake in a document other than the international 
application as filed, including a mistake in a correction or an amendment of the 
international application – the date on which the document was submitted. 
 
(g)  A mistake shall not be rectifiable under this Rule if: 
 
(i) the mistake lies in the omission of one or more entire elements of the 
international application referred to in Article 3(2) or one or more entire sheets of 
the international application; 
 
(ii) the mistake is in the abstract; 
 
(iii) the mistake is in an amendment under Article 19, unless the 
International Preliminary Examining Authority is competent to authorize the 
rectification of such mistake under paragraph (b)(iii);  or 
 
(iv) the mistake is in a priority claim or in a notice correcting or adding a 
priority claim under Rule 26bis.1(a), where the rectification of the mistake would 
cause a change in the priority date; 
provided that this paragraph shall not affect the operation of Rules 20.4, 20.5, 
26bis and 38.3. 
 
(h)  Where the receiving Office, the International Searching Authority, the 
International Preliminary Examining Authority or the International Bureau 
discovers what appears to be a rectifiable obvious mistake in the international 
application or another document, it may invite the applicant to request 
rectification under this Rule. 
91.2   Requests for Rectification 
 
A request for rectification under Rule 91.1 shall be submitted to the

mistake to be rectified and the proposed rectification, and may, at the option of 
the applicant, contain a brief explanation.  Rule 26.4 shall apply mutatis mutandis 
as to the manner in which the proposed rectification shall be indicated. 
 

 
 
 
227 
91.3   Authorization and Effect of Rectifications 
 
(a)  The competent authority shall promptly decide whether to authorize or 
refuse to authorize a rectification under Rule 91.1 and shall promptly notify the

case of refusal, of the reasons therefor.  The International Bureau shall proceed as 
provided for in the Administrative Instructions, including, as required, notifying 
the receiving Office, the International Searching Authority, the International 
Preliminary Examining Authority and the designated and elected Offices of the 
authorization or refusal.

Rule 91.1, the International Bureau shall, upon request submitted to it by the 
applicant within two months from the date of the refusal, and subject to the

reasons and comments (if any) shall if possible be included in the communication 
under Article 20 where the international application is not published by virtue of 
Article 64(3).

any designated Office in which the processing or examination of the international 
application has already started prior to the date on which that Office is notified 
under Rule 91.3(a) of the authorization of the rectification by the competent 
authority. 
 
(f)  A designated Office may disregard a rectification that was authorized 
under Rule 91.1 only if it finds that it would not have authorized the rectification 
under Rule 91.1 if it had been the competent authority, provided that no 
designated Office shall disregard any rectification that was authorized under 
Rule 91.1 without giving the applicant the opportunity to make observations,

within a time limit which shall be reasonable under the circumstances, on the 
Office’s intention to disregard the rectification.

more than one month from the mailing of the invitation.  If the omission is 
remedied within the time limit fixed in the invitation, the omission shall be 
disregarded;  otherwise, the applicant shall be informed that the paper has been
