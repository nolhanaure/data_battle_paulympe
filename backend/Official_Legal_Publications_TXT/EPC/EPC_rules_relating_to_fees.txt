Article 4  
Due date for fees 
(1) 
Fees in respect of which the due date is not specified in the 
provisions of the Convention or of the PCT or of the Implementing Regula-
tions thereto shall be due on the date of receipt of the request for the 
service incurring the fee concerned. 
(2) 
The President of the Office may decide not to make services within 
the meaning of paragraph 1 dependent upon the advance payment of the 
corresponding fee.  
Article 5
Payment of fees 
(1)23 The fees due to the Office shall be paid in euro by payment or 
transfer to a bank account held by the Office. 
(2)24 The President of the Office may allow other methods of paying fees 
than those set out in paragraph 1. 
Article 6  
Particulars concerning payments 
(1) 
Every payment must indicate the name of the person making the 
payment and must contain the necessary particulars to enable the Office to 
establish immediately the purpose of the payment. 
(2) 
If the purpose of the payment cannot immediately be established, the 
Office shall require the person making the payment to notify it in writing of 
this purpose within such period as it may specify. If he does not comply 
with this request in due time the payment shall be considered not to have 
been made. 
Article 7
Date to be considered as the date on which payment is made 
(1) 
The date on which any payment shall be considered to have been 
made to the Office shall be the date on which the amount of the payment or 
of the transfer is actually entered in a bank account held by the Office. 
 


10 
(2) 
Where the President of the Office allows, in accordance with the 
provisions of Article 5, paragraph 2, other methods of paying fees than 
those set out in Article 5, paragraph 1, he shall also lay down the date on 
which such payments shall be considered to have been made.  
(3) 
Where, under the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, payment of a fee 
is not considered to have been made until after the expiry of the period in 
which it should have been made, it shall be considered that this period has 
been observed if evidence is provided to the Office that the person who 
made the payment fulfilled one of the following conditions in a Contracting 
State within the period within which the payment should have been made:  
(i) 
he effected the payment through a banking establishment; 
(ii) 
he duly gave an order to a banking establishment to transfer the 
amount of the payment. 
(4) 
The Office may request the person who made the payment to 
produce evidence as to the date on which a condition according to 
paragraph 3 was fulfilled within a period to be specified by it. If he fails to 
comply with this request or if the evidence is insufficient, the period for 
payment shall be considered not to have been observed. 
Article 8
Insufficiency of the amount paid 
A time limit for payment shall in principle be deemed to have been 
observed only if the full amount of the fee has been paid in due time. If the 
fee is not paid in full, the amount which has been paid shall be refunded 
after the period for payment has expired. The Office may, however, in so 
far as this is possible within the time remaining before the end of the period, 
give the person making the payment the opportunity to pay the amount 
lacking. It may also, where this is considered justified, overlook any small 
amounts lacking without prejudice to the rights of the person making the 
payment. 
Article 9  
Refund of search fees 
(1)27 The search fee paid for a European or supplementary European 
search shall be fully refunded if the European patent application is 
withdrawn or refused or deemed to be withdrawn at a time when the Office

(2)28 Where the European search report is based on an earlier search 
report prepared by the Office on an application whose priority is claimed or 
an earlier application within the meaning of Article 76 of the Convention or 
of Rule 17 of the Convention, the Office shall refund to the applicant, in 
accordance with a decision of its President, an amount which shall depend 
on the type of earlier search and the extent to which the Office benefits 
from the earlier search report when carrying out the subsequent search.  
Article 10  
Refund of the fee for a technical opinion 
An amount of 75% of the fee for a technical opinion under Article 25 of the 
Convention shall be refunded if the request for a technical opinion is 
withdrawn at a time when the Office has not yet begun to draw up the 
technical opinion. 
Article 11 
Refund of examination fee 
The examination fee provided for in Article 94, paragraph 1, of the 
Convention shall be refunded:  
(a) 
in full if the European patent application is withdrawn, refused or 
deemed to be withdrawn before the substantive examination has begun; 
(b) 
at a rate of 50% if the European patent application is withdrawn after 
substantive examination has begun and 
- 
before expiry of the time limit for replying to the first invitation under 
Article 94, paragraph 3, of the Convention issued by the Examining Division 
proper or, 
- 
if no such invitation has been issued by the Examining Division, 
before the date of the communication under Rule 71, paragraph 3, of the 
Convention. 
Article 12
Refund of insignificant amounts 
Where too large a sum is paid to cover a fee, the excess shall not be 
refunded if the amount is insignificant and the party concerned has not 
 




12 
expressly requested a refund. The President of the Office shall determine 
what constitutes an insignificant amount.  
Article 13 
Termination of financial obligations 
(1) 
Rights of the Organisation to the payment of a fee to the European 
Patent Office shall be extinguished after four years from the end of the 
calendar year in which the fee was due.  
(2) 
Rights against the Organisation for the refunding by the European 
Patent Office of fees or sums of money paid in excess of a fee shall be 
extinguished after four years from the end of the calendar year in which the 
right arose. 
(3) 
The period laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be interrupted in the 
case covered by paragraph 1 by a request for payment of the fee and in the 
case covered by paragraph 2 by a reasoned claim in writing. On 
interruption it shall begin again immediately and shall end at the latest six 
years after the end of the year in which it originally began, unless, in the 
meantime, judicial proceedings to enforce the right have begun; in this case 
the period shall end at the earliest one year after the judgment enters into 
force. 
(4) 
The President of the European Patent Office may waive action for the 
enforced recovery of any sum due if the sum to be recovered is minimal or 
if such recovery is too uncertain.

Convention shall be 30% of the relevant fee.

preliminary examination report, the examination fee shall be reduced by 
75%. If the report was established on certain parts of the international 
application in accordance with Article 34, paragraph 3(c), PCT, the fee shall 
not be reduced if subject-matter not covered by the report is to be exam-
ined. 
(3)35 If more than one reduction applies to the same fee for the same 
application, the reductions shall be calculated sequentially.
