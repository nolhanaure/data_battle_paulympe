It was \nintended that EP1 should have the same content as CN1. \nHow can you correct this? What will be the effect on the filing date? \n3. What is the consequence with regard to claiming priority from CN1? What action could \nbe taken?",
    "answer": "Question 4 \n1. EP1 was filed within 12 months of CN1 (31 August 2024, extended to 2 September \n2024), so priority can be added. The declaration of priority can be made up to 16 \nmonths from earliest priority date: 31 December 2024, extended to 2 January 2025. \nAn applicant wishing to claim priority must file a declaration of priority indicating: \ni. \nthe date of the previous application \nii. \nthe state or WTO member in or for which it was filed \niii. \nthe application number \n2. The applicant may file of their own volition the correct description within two months \nof filing (Rule 56a EPC): 2 November 2024, extended to 4 November 2024. Since \npriority was not claimed on filing, Rule 56a(4) EPC does not apply. The application \nis re-dated. \n3. As the new filing date falls outside the 12-month priority period, a request for \nre-establishment in respect of the priority period should also be filed, together with \nreasons. And the fee should be paid."

An authorised representative takes over representation in a previously filed European patent application.\nE. An authorised representative files an international application with the EPO as receiving office.\nF. An authorised representative withdraws a priority claim in an international application.",
    "answer": "Authorisations are needed for B, D and F but not normally for A, C and E.\n \nFor the EPO, signed authorisations must be filed on request and it is up to the EPO to request them (Guidelines A-VIII, 1.6). \n \nRe: A and D: For professional representatives authorisation will only be requested in certain cases, and not normally for newly filed EP applications. The situation in D, where an authorised representative takes over the prosecution of a previously filed European application, is one of the special cases where an authorisation is required (Decision of the President dated 12 July 2007, Special Edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, L.1).\n \nRe: B and C: Authorisations are required for employees representing their employer (Article 133(3) EPC) and for legal practitioners acting in accordance with Article 134(8) EPC (Guidelines A-VIII, 1.3, 1.5 and 1.8). However, the filing of a new patent application is exempted from this requirement (Rule 152(6) EPC and Decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007).\n \nRe: E and F: According to Rule 90.1 PCT a person acting as agent must be appointed. This must be done by all applicants either signing the request or a separate power of attorney (Rule 90.4(a) PCT). Any RO, ISA, SISA or IPEA may waive the requirement, and the EPO has submitted such a waiver (PCT Applicant’s Guide, International Phase Introduction, Annex C: EPO). Hence, for filing an international application with the EPO as RO no authorisation is needed. However, Rule 90.4(e) PCT says that a power of attorney is always needed for any notice of withdrawal, including withdrawal of a priority claim (PCT Applicant’s Guide, International phase, 5.044 and 5.045).\n \nIn each case, if the authorisation is not filed in due time, any action that must be performed by a representative will be considered not to have been performed. The actual consequence will vary depending on the action."

Will the EPO accept this?\n \nYes \nNo\nOnly if the patentee does not object",
    "answer": "The correct answer is A. \nIt is permissible to file an opposition in one’s own name while acting on behalf of a third party (G 3/97 and G 4/97). The only two situations that might be considered abuse of process would be if the opponent was acting on behalf of the proprietor, company Y, or the opponent was de facto acting as a professional representative without being qualified. Since in this case the attorney is a qualified European patent attorney acting on behalf of company X, this situation does not arise.\nCompany X will not be party to the proceedings so it will be dependent on the representative during opposition proceedings."

    "question": "Question 31\n\nEuropean patent EP-B is granted with a claim directed to a method of operating a heart pacemaker in dependence upon the required cardiac output while a person is exercising, the pacemaker including a pressure sensing means mounted on a pacing lead and adapted to be implanted in a heart and used to sense the right ventricular systolic pressure, which pressure is used to control the pacer rate. Is it permissible in opposition or opposition appeal proceedings to amend the claim to be directed to a heart pacemaker in order to address problems relating to Article 53(c) EPC?\n\nA. Yes, a change in claim category is permitted.\n \nB. No, a change in claim category would contravene Article 123(3) EPC.",
    "answer": "The correct answer is B. \nA change in claim category from a method of operating a device to the device itself, i.e. deleting the “method features” defining therapeutic operation of the device, would broaden the claim and contravene Article 123(3) EPC (Guidelines H-V, 7.3). The features of the pacemaker as defined in the device claim do not depend on the circumstances of its operation, but they did under the terms of the prior method claim (“while a person is exercising”). If the original claim contains the claimed features of the device exhaustively, the change of category may be allowable (Guidelines H-V, 7.3). This condition is not fulfilled. \nMethod features relating to how the pacemaker is installed in and interacts with the human body cannot be converted to device features, amongst other things because an “adapted to” type formulation does not confer the same limitation. For example, a “pressure sensing means adapted to sense the right ventricular systolic pressure” is not limited to such use, since it can e.g. be used to sense the left ventricular systolic pressure (T 82/93, Reasons 2.2 and 2.3)."

    "answer": "The correct answer is B. \n \nThe fees will be accepted as if they had been paid within the one-month period. This is because it is extremely unlikely that the receiving office will have issued an invitation to pay the fees originally due together with the late payment fee (Rule 16bis.1 PCT) by 11 December 2023 and any payment made before the issue of the invitation is considered to have been made in due time (PCT Applicant's Guide International Phase 5.193 and 5.194)."

The 31-month period expired on 14 October 2023 (Saturday, extended to 16 October 2023). Since the 31-month time limit was not met, the EPO will issue a communication to the applicant under Rule 160(2) EPC and there will be a two-month period for entry into the EPO regional phase using further processing (Article 121(1) and Rule 135 EPC). On 30 October, the client is therefore well within the two-month period for requesting further processing. It is not necessary to wait for the communication to be issued, but the further processing fee must still be paid in addition to the other fees and acts for entry into the EPO regional phase. \nAlternative B is not an option (and would also have been less preferable).

    "answer": "The correct answer is A, within one month of the expiry of 31 months from the filing date of the priority right to be restored. \nAccording to Rule 26bis.2(c)(iii) PCT a priority claim will not be considered void simply because the international application has a filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired, provided that the filing date is within two months of that date.

It is also too late to restore the priority under Article 122 EPC, which would have had to happen no later than two months after the 12-month time limit set by Article 87 (1) EPC.\nFP2 is not a valid priority document for subject-matter A because it was not the first filing for it (Article 87(4) EPC), so the effective date of claim 1 of EP1 is the filing date of EP1.\nFP1 is pending, so it follows that it has been published 18 months after its filing, which is after the filing of FP2 but before the filing of EP1, making it part of the prior art under Article 54(2) EPC for claim 1 in EP1, which is not entitled to priority from FP2.\nThe disclosure of subject-matter A in FP1 takes away the novelty of claim 1 in EP1.\nSubject-matter A+B was disclosed for the first time in FP2, making FP2 the first filing for this subject-matter. The priority claim is therefore valid for A+B. The effective date for claim 2 is before the publication of FP1, so FP1 cannot be cited as prior art against it."

Legal questions 2016/PE/EN",
    "answer": "Question 8 The subject-matter of claim 2 lacks novelty, since product P is known in the art, Article 54(2) EPC. The process is stated to be more efficient and ecological, but it is not stated to provide a product with different features, Guidelines, F-IV, 4.12. According to Article 64(2) EPC, if the subject-matter of a European patent is a process, the protection conferred by the patent extends to the product directly obtained by such process. Even if a claim directed to a production process is inventive, no conclusion can be drawn regarding a product obtained by the same process: the product may be not even novel, as is presently the case. The terms \"obtainable\", \"obtained\" or \"directly obtained\" are used in the product-by-process claim to define the product per se, Guidelines, F-IV, 4.12.

Claim analysis 2016/PE/EN  Description of the client’s European patent application [001] The invention relates to a saucepan with an integrated strainer. [002] A known saucepan includes a container having an upper opening and a lid with a knob wherein, in use, the lid closes the upper opening. After cooking, usually it is necessary to separate a solid content from a liquid present in the cooked food. Commonly this is accomplished by lifting the lid off the container and pouring the whole cooked content of the saucepan into a separate strainer. The solid content is retained in the strainer, whereas the liquid is strained away. [003] FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a saucepan in accordance with a first embodiment of this invention. FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view of a saucepan in accordance with a second embodiment of this invention. Fig 3 is an exploded perspective view of a saucepan in accordance with a third embodiment of this invention. [004] In the first embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 1 a saucepan includes a container 10 and a lid 15. The container 10 has a circular upper opening 70 and a side wall 25. The lid 15 has a form such that the circular upper opening 70 of the container 10 can be closed by the lid 15 during cooking. The lid 15 can be provided with a knob 27. The container 10 can further comprise a handle 20. [005] The lid 15 comprises a skirt 40 protruding from the rim of the lid. The skirt 40 has at least a solid section 50 which has no openings and fits against the inner wall of the container 10 when the lid 15 closes the container. The skirt 40 also comprises a straining section 45. The straining section 45 provides a plurality of perforations through which liquid content of the container can be strained. The perforations are all of the same size and are dimensioned such as to only allow liquid to pass through them. [006] The saucepan of the first embodiment further comprises a spout 30 located on the side wall 25 of the container 10. The spout 30 is a lip protruding from the side wall 25 for pouring out the content of the saucepan. Claim analysis 2016/PE/EN  [007] During cooking, the lid 15 can be rotated within the container 10 to a cooking position in which the solid section 50 of the skirt 40 closes the spout 30. The lid 15 in this position prevents for example boiling liquid from escaping through the spout 30. [008] After cooking, the lid 15 can be rotated within the container 10 to a straining position such that the straining section 45 can be placed in communication with the spout 30. In the straining position, the lid 15 allows the liquid content of the container 10 to be strained by tilting the saucepan and holding the lid 15 on the container 10 without lifting the lid 15 away from the container 10. [009] The saucepan is further equipped with securing means. The securing means secure the lid to the container. In this manner the user of the saucepan does not need to hold the knob of the lid manually when tilting the container during straining. The securing means are engaged whenever the lid is rotated to the straining position. [010] In the first embodiment of the invention as shown in FIG. 1 the securing means comprise one or more triangular shaped locking tabs 60 protruding outwardly from the skirt 40. Locking tabs 60 cooperate with corresponding triangular shaped locking tabs 65 provided on the inner surface of the side wall 25. The locking tabs 60, 65 are located such that when the lid 15 is rotated to the straining position, the locking tabs 60 of the lid engage under the corresponding locking tabs 65 of the container 10 to secure the lid 15 in place. To disengage the locking tabs 60, 65 from each other, the lid 15 is rotated in the opposite direction away from the straining position. Claim analysis 2016/PE/EN  [011] In the second embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 2, the skirt 40 comprises a ring 53 and four protrusions 45, 50 protruding from the ring 53, the protrusions 45, 50 being separate from each other. One protrusion is the straining section 45 and the other protrusions are the solid sections 50, corresponding to the solid sections as described for the first embodiment. The open space without wall between the straining section 45 and the solid sections 50 provides an opening 55 in the skirt 40. [012] Located on the side wall 25 of the container is a circular opening 35, instead of the spout 30 of FIG. 1. As for the first embodiment, during cooking, the lid 15 can be rotated within the container 10 to a cooking position in which a solid section 50 of the skirt 40 closes the circular opening 35. After cooking, the lid 15 can be rotated within the container 10 to a straining position where the straining section 45 is placed in communication with the circular opening 35. The lid 15 can also be rotated to a pouring position where the opening 55 is placed in communication with the circular opening 35. The dimension of the opening 55 is greater than the dimension of the circular opening 35. In this pouring position, the content of the container 10 can be poured out through the circular opening 35. [013] The securing means of the second embodiment of the invention are rectangular shaped locking tabs 61, 66, instead of the triangular shaped locking tabs 60, 65 of the first embodiment. The rectangular shaped locking tabs 61 of the lid 15 can reversibly engage under the corresponding rectangular shaped locking tabs 66 of the inner surface of the side wall 25 when the lid 15 is rotated to the straining position. Claim analysis 2016/PE/EN  [014] In the third embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 3, the skirt 40 of the lid 15 comprises a straining section 45. The skirt 40 further comprises the opening 55 of greater dimension than any of the perforations of the straining section 45. The side wall 25 of the container 10 comprises a spout 30. The dimension of the opening 55 is greater than the dimension of the spout 30. The lid 15 can be rotated to the pouring position where the opening 55 is placed in communication with the spout 30. In this pouring position, the content of the container 10 can be poured out through the spout 30. [015] FIG. 3 further shows the securing means of the third embodiment. The securing means comprise a plurality of pegs 58 located on the inner surface of side wall 25 and a plurality of corresponding L-shaped slots 59 located on the skirt 40. Pegs 58 and slots 59 are positioned in correspondence to each other such that when the user rotates lid 15 into the straining position, pegs 58 engage the horizontal portions of slots 59, thereby securing the lid 15 to container 10. These are securing means of the bayonet type. [016] The upper surface of the lid 15 of any of the embodiments may comprise an engraved arrow (not shown). When the arrow points towards the handle 20 of the container 10, the lid 15 is placed in the straining position. In this manner the user can bring the lid 15 to the straining position without looking through the spout 30 or the circular opening 35 to identify the position of the straining section. [017] The saucepan in accordance with the invention is very simple to use. The lid 15 can be rotated in the cooking position and in the straining position while keeping the lid 15 on the container 10. When the pieces of cooked food are bigger than the dimension of the opening 55 of the skirt 40, the lid 15 can be lifted off the container 10 to pour out the contents from the circular upper opening 70.

This kitchen utensil comprises a container 1 and a lid 2. Both the container 1 and the lid 2 are made of a light and soft plastic material. [002] The lid 2 can be placed on the upper circular opening of the container 1 to close it. The lid 2 is provided with a dome-shaped top portion 20 with a central knob 21. The top portion 20 is provided with a plurality of perforations 25 all having the same size. The diameter of the perforations 25 is smaller than the size of the vegetables which are washed with cold or at maximum lukewarm water, and which must subsequently be strained. [003] Releasable securing means are further provided for the securing of the lid 2 onto the container 1. Such releasable securing means can be of the bayonet type whereby the inner wall of the container 1 has at least two pegs 12 and the lid 2 has at least two corresponding L-shaped slots 27. [004] In order to secure the lid 2 onto the container 1 it is necessary first to insert the pegs 12 into the open ends of the L-shaped slots 27 and then to rotate the lid 2 with respect to the container 1 until each peg 12 engages the horizontal portion of the respective L-shaped slot 27. [005] During straining, the water flows out through the perforations 25 with the lid 2 being secured to the container 1. The vegetables do not pass through the perforations 25 and are held by the lid 2. The vegetables are then poured out through the circular upper opening of the container 1 after the lid 2 has been lifted off. Claim analysis 2016/PE/EN  FIG. 1 21 20 27 27 12 1 2 25 25 Drawing of D1 Claim analysis 2016/PE/EN  Document D2 [001] As shown in FIG. 1, a saucepan 1 includes a container 2 and a lid 3. The container 2 has a rim 7 defining an upper opening 8 which the lid 3 can close. The container 2 has a handle 9 attached to a side wall. The lid 3 has a knob 15 and a skirt 4. [002] As shown in FIG. 2, the skirt 4 provides straining zones through which liquid contents can be strained out of the container. The straining zones comprise a plurality of perforations 19. Preferably, a first straining zone is provided with perforations of one size and a second straining zone is provided with perforations of a larger size (not shown). The larger perforations can be dimensioned such as to allow to pour out solid contents. [003] The lid 3 and the skirt 4 are shaped and sized so that when the lid 3 completely closes the container 2, the skirt 4 is located within the container 2 whereby a clearance between the skirt 4 and the inner surface of the side wall 6 of the container 2 is present. In this way, the lid 3 together with the skirt 4 can be lifted straight out of the container 2. [004] The skirt 4 is used to strain liquid contents from within the container 2. This is shown in FIG. 3 in a cross section. When a finger of a user presses on a part of the rim of the lid 3, the lid 3 can be pivoted by an angle alpha (α) from the container 2. The shape and size of the skirt 4 is such that the bottom part 42 of the skirt 4, when the lid 3 is pivoted by the angle alpha (α), engages with the inner surface of the side wall 6 and blocks in this position. As a result, the lid 3 and the bottom part 42 of the skirt 4 are held in this position thereby partially opening the container 2. The liquid content can exit through the perforations 19 whilst the engagement of the bottom part 42 of the skirt 4 with the inner side wall 6 prevents solid contents from escaping out of the container 2.

[002] The skirt 10 with the openings 11 provides an annular straining portion of the lid 9. The straining portion is in communication with the spout 7 in any seated position of the lid 9 on the container 5. [003] When the user carefully tilts the container 5 while holding the lid 9 in place with a free hand, only the liquid content passes through the openings 11 and can be poured out of the container, whilst solid content, such as cooked vegetables, is retained within the container 5. Claim analysis 2016/PE/EN  Document D4 [001] FIG. 1 shows a saucepan in a cross section comprising a container 1 and a lid 4. The lid 4 can be locked to the container 1 by one or more bayonet joints. Each bayonet joint comprises an L-shaped slot 6 in a cylindrical skirt of the lid 4 and a peg 62 on the inner surface of the side wall of the container 1. The peg 62 engages into the slot 6 as shown in FIG. 1. [002] The lid 4 further comprises an opening 2, as shown in the exploded perspective view of FIG. 2. This opening 2 is large enough to permit the vapour to escape from the saucepan when the pressure inside the saucepan exceeds a threshold pressure. The opening 2 is closed by means of a cap 5. The weight of the cap 5 corresponds to the force exerted on it by the vapour at the threshold pressure. The saucepan therefore functions as a pressure cooker.

Claim analysis 2012/PE/EN  Questions 11-20 relate to a European patent application filed by your client with the following description and drawings: Description of Client’s Patent Application [001] The invention relates to closures that are used to seal bottles. [002] D1 describes a prior art closure connected by thermal welding to a bottle. A projection is folded back on top of the main part of the closure. The projection forms a pull-tab for removing the closure from the bottle. The pull-tab can break away from the main part of the closure during mounting or removal of a screw cap so that the pull-tab is no longer available for removing the closure from the bottle. [003] The invention is defined in the claims. [004] FIGS. 1-3 illustrate a first embodiment of a closure 10 that covers an opening 42 of a bottle 40. The closure 10 includes a tab part 12 and a sealing part 20. A first portion of the tab part 12 is firmly attached to the sealing part 20. A second portion of the tab part is lightly attached to the sealing part (FIG. 2). The second portion of the tab part 12 can be released to form a pull-tab 18 (FIGS. 1 and 3). The pull-tab 18 can be gripped to remove the closure 10 from the bottle 40. FIG. 2 also shows a screw cap 46 that is screwed onto the bottle 40 and covers the closure 10. [005] In the first embodiment, the sealing part 20 of the closure is formed from a laminated sheet comprising a polyester film 22 and a metal foil 24, for example an aluminium foil. The metal foil 24 seals the product in the bottle 40. The polyester film 22 prevents the metal foil 24 from tearing as the closure 10 is removed from the bottle. Claim analysis 2012/PE/EN  [006] A thermoweldable material 26 is provided on the lower surface of the polyester film 22. The thermoweldable material 26 is a material that softens on being heated and can be used to weld the closure 10 to the top of the bottle 40. The thermoweldable material 26 can be softened by heating (e. g. by inductively heating) the metal foil 24. [007] The tab part 12 is formed by a polyester film. The tab part 12 is attached to the metal foil 24 of the sealing part 20 (the upper surface of the sealing part 20) by an adhesive layer 32. The adhesive layer 32 includes a continuous adhesive portion 34, and a discontinuous adhesive portion which is preferably formed by two or more adhesive dots 36. [008] The continuous adhesive portion 34 completely covers a first portion of the upper surface of the sealing part 20 (forming up to half of the area), and permanently attaches the first portion of the tab part 12 to the sealing part 20. The discontinuous adhesive portion provides an incomplete layer of adhesive. Preferably the discontinuous adhesive portion is distributed over the remainder of the upper surface of the sealing part 20. [009] The size of the adhesive dots 36 determines the degree of adhesion of the second portion of the tab part 12 to the sealing part 20. The degree of adhesion is determined so as to prevent separation of the second portion of the tab part 12 from the sealing part 20 during attachment of the screw cap 46, but to enable a user to peel the second portion of the tab part 12 away from the sealing part 20 to form the pull-tab 18. [010] FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view illustrating the top of the bottle 40 with the closure 10 covering the opening 42 of the bottle and the screw cap 46 covering the closure 10. Claim analysis 2012/PE/EN  [011] FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a method of opening the bottle 40. Firstly, the screw cap 46 is removed in the direction of the arrow 44. The pull-tab 18 is then peeled away from the sealing part 20. The pull-tab 18 is then pulled in the direction of the arrow 48 to cause the thermal weld of the sealing part 20 to the bottle 40 to break under the continuous adhesive portion 34. The pull-tab 18 is then pulled further in the direction of the arrow 48 until the closure 10 is removed from the bottle 40. [012] FIG. 4 illustrates a second embodiment of a closure 50 comprising a sealing part 20 configured to provide evidence of tampering on removing the closure by pulling the pull-tab 18. The sealing part 20 of the second embodiment only comprises the metal foil 24. The thermoweldable material 26 is provided on the lower surface of the metal foil 24 in the second embodiment. The second embodiment is otherwise constructed in the same manner as the first embodiment. The second embodiment of the closure functions and is removed in a manner similar to that of the first embodiment of the closure 10 illustrated in FIGS. 1-3. However, without the polyester film 22, the metal foil 24 tears as the closure 50 is removed from the bottle 40. A tear in the metal foil 24 therefore provides evidence of tampering in the second embodiment. Claim analysis 2012/PE/EN  Drawings of client's application Claim analysis 2012/PE/EN  Document D1 [001] FIG. 1 is a cross-section through part of a bottle 1 provided with a cap 4 that is screwed to a threaded portion 3 of the neck 2 of the bottle 1. The cap 4 can be unscrewed from the bottle to expose a closure 5. The closure 5 comprises a pull-tab 8 that can be gripped to remove the closure 5 from the bottle 1 by pulling on the pull-tab 8. [002] As shown in FIGS. 1-2, the pull-tab 8 is folded back on top of a main part 6 of the closure 5. The main part 6 of the closure 5 is circular.

Claim analysis 2013/PE/EN  Description of Client’s Patent Application (Filed on 01.03.2010) [001] The present invention relates to stoppers for wine bottles. [002] Bottle stoppers for wine bottles comprising a body made of cork are known (see for example document D1). Cork is provided from layers of bark of cork oak trees. Cork is a material with a randomly distributed, continuous network of interconnected air channels running through the material. The material itself is impermeable to liquids and to gasses such as air. However, gasses can flow through the interconnected air channels. Thus, cork is impermeable to liquids, but permeable to gasses such as air. When a bottle stopper made of cork closes the neck of a bottle, gasses can flow through the interconnected air channels of the cork between the interior and the exterior of the bottle. An exchange of gasses between the interior of the bottle and the exterior of the bottle is necessary for the wine to mature. The optimal rate of exchange of gasses through the stopper differs from wine to wine. [003] A drawback with these known stoppers is that the gas permeability of the cork varies greatly depending on the tree from which it was sourced. It is therefore difficult to predict how quickly wine will mature in bottles closed with these stoppers. [004] It is an object of the present invention to provide bottle stoppers which overcome this drawback. This object is achieved by the subject-matter of the attached claims. [005] Brief description of the drawings: FIG. 1 shows a bottle stopper 10 according to a first embodiment of the invention, with one half cut away. FIG. 2 shows a bottle stopper 20 according to a second embodiment of the invention, with one half cut away. FIG. 3 shows a bottle stopper 30 according to a third embodiment of the invention, with one half cut away. Claim analysis 2013/PE/EN  [006] The bottle stopper 10 of FIG. 1 comprises a body 2. The body 2 is made of synthetic rubber. The synthetic rubber is impermeable to liquid and gas. The bottle stopper 10 further comprises a narrow air channel 3, which extends through the body 2. When the stopper closes the neck of a bottle, gasses can flow through the air channel between the interior and the exterior of the bottle. Because the air channel 3 is very narrow, liquid cannot flow through it. The optimal rate of exchange of gasses for maturing a specific wine can be achieved by selecting a stopper 10 having an air channel 3 of an appropriate diameter. [007] The second embodiment of our invention enables the rate of exchange of gasses through a stopper to be more precisely determined. The bottle stopper 20 of FIG. 2 comprises all the components of the bottle stopper 10 shown in FIG. 1. The bottle stopper 20 additionally comprises a filter plate 4. The filter plate 4 is attached to the body 2 with glue. [008] The filter plate 4 can for example be made of an aluminium foil with perforations forming micro air channels. The filter plate 4 has a predetermined permeability to gasses such as air but is impermeable to liquids. The filter plate 4 therefore prevents liquids from coming into contact with the air channel 3. The diameter of the air channel 3 and the gas permeability of the filter plate 4 determine the gas permeability of the stopper 20. [009] The filter plate may fall into the wine if it is pushed away from the body of the stopper by a corkscrew when opening the wine bottle. For this reason bottle stoppers of the second embodiment should be made longer than conventional bottle stoppers. Claim analysis 2013/PE/EN  [010] The bottle stopper 30 of FIG. 3 comprises a body 2. The body 2 is made of synthetic rubber. The synthetic rubber is impermeable to all fluids, whereby the term fluids includes both liquids and gasses. The bottle stopper 30 further comprises a first air channel 3a, a second air channel 3b and a filter plate 34. The first air channel 3a extends from a first planar surface of the stopper 30 through the body 2. The second air channel 3b continues from the first air channel 3a and extends through the body 2 up to a second planar surface opposite to the first planar surface. The filter plate 34 is fixed within the body 2 so that gasses can flow between the first air channel 3a and the second air channel 3b through a part of the filter plate 34. Fixing the filter plate 34 within the body prevents the filter plate 34 from falling into the wine by the action of a corkscrew. [011] The filter plate 34 can be made of any metal foil with perforations forming micro air channels, thereby providing a predictable permeability to gasses such as air but being impermeable to liquids. Hence, the gas permeability of the stopper 30 is determined by selecting the diameter of the air channels 3a and 3b and by selecting a filter plate 34 with a predetermined gas permeability. Claim analysis 2013/PE/EN  Drawings of Client's Application Claim analysis 2013/PE/EN  Document D1 (Published June 2000) [001] FIG. 1 shows a stopper 100 for closing a bottle, with one half cut away. The stopper 100 is made of cork. Cork is provided from layers of bark of cork oak trees. Cork is a material with a randomly distributed, continuous network of interconnected air channels running through the material. The material itself is impermeable to liquids and to gasses such as air. However, gasses can flow through the interconnected air channels. Thus, a stopper made of cork is impermeable to liquids, but permeable to gasses such as air. [002] An exchange of gasses between the interior of the bottle and the exterior of the bottle is necessary for the wine to mature. When the bottle stopper 100 closes the neck of a bottle, gasses can flow between the interior and the exterior of the bottle via the air channels 103. The optimal rate of exchange of gasses through the cork differs from wine to wine. Claim analysis 2013/PE/EN",

    "question": "QUESTION 2 European patent application EP-P was filed as a first filing on 2 December 2011 and was published on 13 June 2013. European patent application EP-D was filed with the EPO on 6 December 2013 as a divisional application of EP-P. Today, 24 February 2014, you received the first communication of the examining division under Article 94(3) EPC regarding EP-P. EP-P is still pending.

    "answer": "Question 2 The European divisional application EP-D can be validly filed as long as the earlier application (in this case EP-P) is pending, Rule 36(1) EPC. EP-D has to be filed before the time limit of twenty-four months for filing a divisional application to EP-P has expired. This time limit is triggered by the first communication under Article 94(3) EPC in respect of EP-P, Rule 36(1)(a) EPC as entered into force on 26 October 2010. Even if EP-D contains subject-matter extending beyond the content of the earlier application as originally filed, it cannot be converted into an independent application taking 6 December 2013 as its date of filing (Guidelines C-IX, 1.4 or G1/05, Reasons 11.1).

The applicant now realises that, although most of the embodiments are sufficiently disclosed, the embodiment X1 lacks essential technical information and is therefore not sufficiently disclosed. For each of the statements 10.1 – 10.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the statement is true or false: 10.1 An objection of the examining division under Article 83 EPC regarding embodiment X1 can be overcome by filing additional technical information. 10.2 If the examining division does not raise any objections under Article 83 EPC, lack of sufficiency of disclosure will not be a valid ground for opposition against EP-T. 10.3 A valid option is to correct the technical information under Rule 139 EPC before the publication of EP-T. 10.4 Before the publication of EP-T, it is not possible to amend the description of EP-T in order to delete embodiment X1. Claim analysis 2014/PE/EN  Description of the application [001] The present invention relates to liquid soap dispensers. [002] Liquid soap dispensers which comprise a bottle wherein a pump is screwed onto the opening of the bottle are known. A dispenser containing liquid soap is shown in FIG. 1 of D1. The dispenser comprises a bottle with a threaded neck, a hand pump with a dispensing nozzle that screws onto the opening of the bottle, and a tube that extends from the hand pump into the bottle. The tube does not extend as far as the base of the bottle: the end of the tube does not contact the base of the bottle. The liquid soap used in D1 is an aqueous suspension. [003] A drawback of the liquid soap dispenser of D1 is that too much liquid soap is left at the base of the bottle that cannot be removed from the bottle, because the end of the tube does not contact the base of the bottle. [004] FIG. 1 shows a cross section of a liquid soap dispenser containing liquid soap according to a first embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2 shows a cross section of a liquid soap dispenser containing liquid soap according to a second embodiment of the invention. FIG. 3 shows a cross section of a liquid soap dispenser containing liquid soap according to a third embodiment of the invention. FIG. 4 shows a perspective view of a liquid soap dispenser according to the invention. FIG. 5 shows a perspective view of a refill liquid soap bottle according to the invention. [005] FIG. 1 shows a liquid soap dispenser 10 according to the first embodiment of the invention. The dispenser 10 comprises a bottle 11 and a hand pump 12 with a dispensing nozzle 13. The hand pump 12 is fixed onto the opening of the bottle 11. The base 11a of the bottle 11 is flat. A tube 14 extends from the hand pump 12 into the bottle 11 and is in contact with the flat base 11a of the bottle 11. An end part 14a of the tube 14 has an L-shaped profile so that the end part 14a of the tube 14 extends along the flat base 11a of the bottle 11. Claim analysis 2014/PE/EN  [006] FIG. 2 shows a liquid soap dispenser 20 according to the second embodiment of the invention. The base 21a of a bottle 21 of the liquid soap dispenser 20 has a dome- shaped profile. When a hand pump 22 is screwed onto the opening of the bottle 21, an end part 24a of a tube 24 is bent and guided by the dome-shaped base 21a towards the lowest part 21b of the bottle 21. Nearly all the soap can be removed from the bottle 21 using this liquid soap dispenser 20; only a small amount of soap is left at the base of the bottle 21. [007] FIG. 3 shows a liquid soap dispenser 30 according to the third embodiment of the invention. The base 31a of a bottle 31 of the liquid soap dispenser 30 has a V-shaped profile. When a hand pump 32 is screwed onto the opening of the bottle 31, a tube 34 is bent by the V-shaped base 31a and an end part 34a of the tube 34 is guided towards the well 31b of the V-shaped base 31a. Because the well 31b has a very small volume nearly all the soap can be removed from the bottle 31 with this liquid soap dispenser 30. This dispenser is particularly suited for expensive liquid soaps. [008] FIG. 4 shows the exterior of a liquid soap dispenser according to our invention. It comprises a bottle 1 and a pump 2 with a nozzle 3. The pump 2 is fixed onto the opening of the bottle 1. Any conventional pump can be used. [009] As shown in FIG. 5, the bottles of the liquid soap dispensers of all the above described embodiments of the invention can also be closed by a screw cap 43. The user then replaces the screw cap 43 by one of the corresponding pump-nozzle-tube systems of a used liquid soap dispenser in accordance with one of the above embodiments. [010] In all the embodiments of the invention we use liquid soap compositions containing water, detergent and 20 to 25 percent by weight of glycerine based on the total weight of the liquid soap composition. For example, the detergent is a blend of palmitate and stearate soaps. Preferably, the composition does not include non-ionic detergents. Claim analysis 2014/PE/EN  Drawings of Client's Application Claim analysis 2014/PE/EN  Drawings of Client's Application Claim analysis 2014/PE/EN  Document D1 [001] It is convenient to wash hands with liquid soap. FIG. 1 shows a cross section of our liquid soap dispenser 100 containing liquid soap. It comprises a bottle 110 with a threaded neck and a hand pump 120 which screws onto the opening of the bottle 110. The hand pump 120 has a dispensing nozzle 130 and a tube 140 which extends towards the base of the bottle 110. In order to prevent the tube 140 from being obstructed by the base of the bottle 110, the length of the tube 140 is chosen so that it does not contact the base of the bottle 110. [002] As liquid soap we use an aqueous suspension comprising water, detergent and suspended abrasive particles. Claim analysis 2014/PE/EN  Document D2 [001] A problem with known liquid soap dispensers is that some of the product cannot be removed from the base of the bottle. We have developed a liquid soap dispenser 200 as shown in FIG. 1. The liquid soap dispenser 200 containing liquid soap comprises a bottle 210, a hand pump 220, a dispensing nozzle 230 and a tube 240. The tube 240 extends down to the base of the bottle 210 such that the tube 240 is bent and the end of the tube 240 extends along the base of the bottle 210. Claim analysis 2014/PE/EN  Document D3 [001] We sell washing-up liquids in squeezable plastic bottles. FIG. 1 shows a bottle 310 containing a liquid with a base having a dome-shaped profile. This dome-shaped profile of the bottle's base ensures a stable stand on a flat surface, even if the material the bottle 310 is made of is very thin. The opening of the bottle 310 has a screw cap with a nozzle 330. A tube 340 extends from the nozzle 330 inside the bottle 310. [002] To remove the liquid, the bottle 310 is turned upside down and squeezed. A user is able to control the amount of liquid squeezed out of the bottle 310. Since the neck of the bottle is very narrow, nearly all the liquid can be removed in this way. When the bottle 310 is almost empty it can be rinsed out with warm water to completely remove all liquid from the bottle. [003] The washing-up liquid comprises water, detergents and optionally perfumes and/or colourants. Claim analysis 2014/PE/EN  Document D4 [001] We manufacture liquid soap dispensing systems for wash basins. FIG. 1 shows a liquid soap dispensing system 400 which comprises a manually actuated pump 420 which pumps liquid soap from a reservoir bottle 410. The pump 420 is positioned at the height of a wash basin 450 and the bottle 410 is placed below the pump 420 as shown in FIG. 1. A tube 430 connects the pump 420 with the bottle 410. As shown in FIG. 1 the tube 430 extends horizontally away from the pump and then vertically down into the bottle 410. Claim analysis 2014/PE/EN",
    "answer": "Question 10 The European patent application must disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art, Article 83 EPC. A lack of sufficiency of disclosure cannot be cured by filing additional technical information, since this would offend the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC (see Guidelines, F-III 2). A correction under Rule 139 EPC is not possible either: if it is obvious how the correction reads, then there cannot be any issue of lack of sufficiency of disclosure.

Claim analysis 2015/PE/EN  Description of the application Fire protection door [0001] The invention relates to fire protection doors. [0002] Fire protection doors prevent fire from propagating between different parts of a building. A fire protection door must include a door leaf, a door frame and a door closer. The door leaf and the door frame cooperate to prevent hot gases from passing through the closed door during a minimum protection time. The door closer has to ensure that the fire protection door is closed in the case of a fire. The temperature of the side of the door facing away from the fire must not rise above prescribed maximum temperatures. [0003] Up to now, fire protection doors have only been produced by the metal industry. The known fire protection doors have door leaves made of a metal casing. The metal casing normally is made using metal sheets to form a box and a cover. The space inside the box is filled with a thermally insulating material. Such known metal door leaves have a thickness of 5 cm or more. [0004] This known construction of a fire protection door has several drawbacks. First of all, the appearance and the shape of the door are very limited due to the metal sheets forming the metal casing. Further, the metal casing provides a thermal bridge so that it is difficult to comply with the requirement that the temperature at the side of the door leaf facing away from the fire has to be kept low. Moreover, the known door leaves tend to bend in case of fire: the metal sheet on the fire side of the door leaf expands more than the metal sheet on the cooler side facing away from the fire. This bending may create a gap between the door frame and the door leaf and is the main reason for failure of fire protection doors. Hence, the known door leaves made of metal casings have to be stiffened, for example by additional internal frame structures within the metal casing. Claim analysis 2015/PE/EN  [0005] The object of the invention is to overcome these drawbacks. [0006] An aspect of the invention relates to a door leaf for a fire protection door wherein the door leaf has a plate made of solid wood. For example, the door leaf comprises a plate of solid oak wood. Solid wood is readily available and is resistant to bending. [0007] Although wood is flammable, surprisingly it has been shown that a thick plate of solid wood used as a door leaf is able to withstand a fire for some time. Further, wood is heat-insulating so that no further filling is necessary. Our fire protection doors are produced in the wood manufacturing industry that differs considerably both in manufacturing machines and manufacturing techniques from the metal industry. [0008] One important condition for using a solid wood plate for door leaves of fire protection doors is that the plate is thick enough. With regard to solid oak wood, the plate must have a thickness of at least 8 cm, otherwise the requirements for fire protection doors cannot be fulfilled and the plate will not be suitable for a fire protection door leaf. [0009] Solid wood contains mainly wood fibres that can store moisture. For manufacturing our fire protection door leaf, we preferably use wood that is watered for a sufficient time so that the wood fibres contain enough moisture. When the wooden plate is heated in case of a fire, this moisture is released and evaporates. The evaporation of the moisture provides a cooling effect. [0010] Preferred embodiments are explained in further details with reference to the drawings. Claim analysis 2015/PE/EN  [0011] Fig. 1 shows a sectional view through a fire protection door comprising a door leaf based on wood material. [0012] Fig. 2 shows a front view of a first embodiment of the fire protection door constructed as a pivoting door. [0013] Fig. 3 shows a second embodiment of the fire protection door constructed as a sliding door. [0014] First, the general construction of a door leaf 1 for a fire protection door 10 is explained with reference to Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, a door leaf 1 for a fire protection door 10 has an inner core formed as a plate 2 of solid oak wood having a thickness D of at least 8 cm. Solid oak wood burns very slowly. When using any other type of solid wood, the thickness D must be at least 10 cm. [0015] Preferably, both major surfaces A and B of the plate 2 are at least partially covered by covering layers. By choosing appropriate coverings, the appearance of the door can be adapted to the building where it will be used. The plate 2 of wood can also be made in many different shapes by easy manufacturing steps known in the wood industry. Thus, for example, even very old buildings can be protected by fire protection doors imitating the appearance of ancient doors. [0016] Preferably, the plate 2 is at least partially covered by a metal layer 3, 4. More preferably, both major surfaces A, B of the plate 2 are fully covered by aluminium sheets as metal layers 3, 4. A full covering of the wooden plate 2 by metal layers 3, 4 protects the wooden plate from drying-out. Aluminium has a melting temperature of about 600°C. In a case of fire, the temperature of the door on the fire side exceeds this temperature and the aluminium layer melts. The melting of the covering metal layers 3, 4 helps to keep the temperature low at the side of the door leaf 1 facing away from the fire. Claim analysis 2015/PE/EN  [0017] When the door leaf 1 is used in a pivoting door hinged in pivotal manner to a door frame 8, the side edges of door leaf 1 are stepped, and a corresponding step 7 is provided in the door frame 8. In the closed position, the engagement between the stepped door leaf 1 and the stepped door frame 8 provides a kind of labyrinth seal 9 that hinders hot gases from passing the door. However, such a stepped door leaf 1 is not suited for sliding doors. Many different sizes and shapes of steps are possible, however the step in the door leaf 1 and the step 7 in the door frame 8 must fit to each other; hence, door leaf 1 and door frame 8 of the fire protection door 10 are specially adapted to each other. [0018] The first embodiment of the fire protection door 10 shown in Fig. 2 has a stepped door leaf 1a, a door frame 8 and a door closer 12. The door leaf 1a is connected via door hinges 13 to the door frame 8 so that it can pivot between a closed and an open position. The door closer 12 biases the door leaf 1a into the closed position. The door closer 12 has a mechanical spring 14 urging the door leaf 1a to the closed position via a lever element 15. [0019] Fig. 3 shows the second embodiment. The fire protection door is a sliding fire protection door 20 having a door leaf 1b and a door frame 21 wherein the door leaf 1b is slidably guided to slide in a direction 22 parallel to its major surfaces. Further, a door closer 23 is provided including a cable 24 and a weight 25. The cable 24 and the weight 25 are hidden within the door frame 21. Because the elements of the door closer 23 are hidden, the door closer 23 is protected from interference and a very safe functioning is ensured.

    "question": "Question 10 The international application PCT-A was validly filed on 4 January 2017 with the EPO. PCT-A validly claims the priority from a Dutch patent application NL-A, filed on 31 January 2016. Today, 6 March 2017, the international search report for PCT-A was transmitted to the applicant. For each of the statements 10.1 – 10.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the statement is true or false: 10.1 An international preliminary examination of PCT-A before the EPO can be validly requested on 30 November 2017. 10.2 A handling fee is due for requesting the international preliminary examination of PCT-A before the EPO. 10.3 The applicant is entitled to communicate orally with the EPO as the International Preliminary Examination Authority. 10.4 If amended claims for PCT-A are received by the International Bureau before the technical preparations for international publication have been completed, then the international publication of PCT-A will also contain the text of the amended claims. Claim analysis 2017/P/EN/12 Description of the Client's Patent Application (Filed on 1 March 2014) [001] The present invention relates to toothbrushes for human use. Toothbrushes are used in combination with toothpaste by women, men and children for removing dental plaque from teeth. [002] Toothbrushes comprise bristles which are joined to a brush body. In known toothbrushes, the brush body comprises a brush head which holds the bristles, a handle held by the user during brushing of his teeth, and a neck between the handle and the bristles. In such known toothbrushes, the bristles are provided as a plurality of bristle bundles. The separate provision of the bristle bundles allows the bristles to be manufactured from a different material than the brush body. The bristle bundles are either joined to the brush head during the production of the brush body, or are joined to the brush head in a separate step after the brush body has been produced. [003] A drawback with these known toothbrushes is that the users need to be trained by dentists in order to achieve optimum dental plaque removal. If the users have not been trained properly, they are likely to achieve less than optimum results. The remaining dental plaque can give rise to dental caries, which is highly undesirable. [004] It is an object of the present invention to provide toothbrushes which overcome this drawback. This object is achieved by the subject-matter of the attached claims. In particular, the present invention is based on the surprising finding that the amount of dental plaque removal can be increased by transmitting additional vibrations to the bristles. These vibrations are generated by an electric vibrator inside the brush body. Preferably, the electrically operated vibrator is located in the handle together with a controller and a battery. In the present invention, the controller acts as a switching means for selectively supplying electric energy from the battery to an electrically operated element, because the controller connects and disconnects the vibrator from the battery. Claim analysis 2017/P/EN/13 [005] Brief description of the drawings: FIG. 1 shows the cross-section of a toothbrush 100 according to a first embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2 shows the cross-section of a toothbrush 200 according to a second embodiment of the invention. FIG. 3 shows the cross-section of a toothbrush 300 according to a third embodiment of the invention. FIG. 4 shows the cross-section of a toothbrush 400 according to a fourth embodiment of the invention. [006] The toothbrush 100 according to the first embodiment of FIG. 1 comprises a unitary brush body in which the brush head is fixedly connected to the handle. The unitary brush body comprises a bristle zone 110, a handle 130 and a neck 111 therebetween. A plurality of bristle bundles 120 are held in the bristle zone 110. The handle 130 comprises a push button 132, a controller 133, a vibrator 134 and a battery 135. The controller 133 is connected with each of the push button 132, the vibrator 134 and the battery 135 by means of electric cables. As long as the controller 133 determines that the user's finger is pressing down the push button 132, electric energy is supplied from the battery 135 to the vibrator 134, and vibrations are generated and transmitted to the bristles. Claim analysis 2017/P/EN/14 [007] The vibrators of the invention are very energy efficient, and the batteries in the inventive toothbrushes will last much longer than the bristles. As a toothbrush with worn- out bristles can hurt its user, the second embodiment of the invention allows the user to replace a worn-out brush head. The toothbrush 200 of FIG. 2 therefore comprises a body formed of a handle 230 and of a replaceable brush head with a bristle zone 210, bristle bundles 220 and a neck 211. The replaceable brush head comprises a connection hole 212 at the end of its neck 211. The connection hole 212 engages with a connection protrusion 231 on the handle 230, and thereby forms a connection section. The connection hole 212 and the connection protrusion 231 do not hinder the transmission of vibrations to the bristles. Once the bristle bundles 220 are worn out, the brush head can be pulled off the handle 230, and be replaced with a fresh brush head. Apart from the connection protrusion 231, the handle 230 also comprises a push button 232, a controller 233, a vibrator 234 and a battery 235. These elements function exactly like the corresponding elements in the first embodiment. Claim analysis 2017/P/EN/15 [008] Some users do not like pressing a push button while they brush their teeth. The third embodiment of the invention according to FIG. 3 therefore provides an alternative to a push button in the handle. The toothbrush 300 automatically detects that the users are brushing their teeth by means of a pressure sensor 313. The pressure sensor 313 is located in the bristle zone 310, for example below the bristle bundles 320. The pressure sensor 313 only generates an electric signal, when the user is pressing the bristles against his teeth. That signal is transmitted to the controller 333, for example by means of an electric cable embedded in the neck 311. As long as the controller 333 receives that signal, electric energy is supplied from the battery 335 to the vibrator 334. The brush head also comprises a connection hole 312 for receiving the connection protrusion 331 of the handle 330. Thereby, the vibrations can be transmitted to the bristles, and electric cables pass through the protrusion 331 and the hole 312 for establishing the electric connection between the pressure sensor 313 and the controller 333. Apart from the controller 333, the handle 330 also comprises the vibrator 334 and the battery 335. These elements function exactly like the corresponding elements in the other embodiments. Like in the second embodiment, a worn out brush head can be replaced by pulling it off the handle 330. Claim analysis 2017/P/EN/16 [009] According to market research, users think that a toothbrush has a higher cleaning efficiency if it looks technical. As the vibrator in the above toothbrushes is not visible, the technical character of these toothbrushes should be emphasised by including additional elements with a technical appearance such as a light-emitting diode (LED). In a fourth embodiment according to FIG. 4, the toothbrush 400 comprises a unitary brush body with a bristle zone 410, bristle bundles 420, a handle 430 and a neck 411 therebetween. In this embodiment, the handle 430 contains a LED 436, which is connected to a controller 433 by means of an electric cable. As long as the controller 433 determines that the user's finger is pressing down the push button 432, electric energy is supplied from the battery 435 to both the vibrator 434 and the LED 436. When users brush their teeth, the LED emits for example blue light while vibrations are generated by the vibrator 434 and transmitted to the bristles. Apart from the LED 436 and the controller 433, the handle 430 also comprises the vibrator 434 and the battery 435. The LED can also be incorporated into the first, the second or the third embodiments of the invention. The toothbrush 400 according to the fourth embodiment can also have a replaceable brush head and a connection section, similar to that of the toothbrushes according to the second and third embodiments. [010] The toothbrushes 100, 200, 300 and 400 according to the above embodiments must have a total length of less than 30 cm, and the toothbrushes with a replaceable brush head must have a total length of between 18 and 25 cm for ergonomic reasons.

    "question": "Question 3 The European patent application EP-A was filed on 29 February 2016. EP-A claims priority from an earlier patent application filed in March 2015. The mention of the grant of a European patent based on EP-A was published in April 2017. An opposition against this patent was validly filed in January 2018. The only ground for opposition raised by the opponent is lack of novelty according to Article 100(a) EPC. The only document cited is the French patent application FR-B published in July 2015 and filed in January 2014. In the notice of opposition, the opponent argues that the priority claimed in EP-A is not valid. For each of the statements 3.1 – 3.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the statement is true or false: 3.1 The validity of the priority right as such is not a ground for opposition under Article 100 EPC. 3.2 FR-B is state of the art under Article 54(2) EPC if the priority of EP-A is not valid. 3.3 If the priority of EP-A is valid, then FR-B belongs to the state of the art under Article 54(3) EPC in view of its earlier filing date. 3.4 If the opponent raises today, 26 February 2018, an objection of lack of sufficiency of disclosure against EP-A, then this is a fresh ground for opposition. Legal questions 2018/P/EN/5",
    "answer": "Question 3 The validity of the priority right as such is not a ground for opposition, since it is not mentioned in Article 100 EPC. If the priority of EP-A is not valid, then the effective date of EP-A in accordance with Article 89 EPC is the filing date of EP-A (29 February 2016). In such a case, FR-B is state of the art according to Article 54(2) EPC, and it can be used to attack novelty (and inventive step) of EP-A. The national application FR-B can only be prior art under Article 54(2) EPC and not under Article 54(3) EPC. Lack of novelty and lack of sufficiency of disclosure are separate grounds for opposition, Article 100 EPC. Moreover, the objection of lack of sufficiency of disclosure was raised after the expiration of the opposition period (see G10/91 and Guidelines, D-V, 2.2).

If the applicant pays the fee for grant and publishing and files the required translation of the claims, then this is considered to be an approval of the text, Rule 71(5) EPC. An appeal against the decision to grant would be an appeal of a not adversely affected party. The applicant can disagree to the text proposed, provided he requests reasoned amendments (Rule 71(6) EPC). The examining division may not resume the examination proceedings (cf.

The time limit for entry into the European phase expires on [29 July 2015 + 31 months =] 28 February 2018, Rule 159(1) EPC and Rule 131(4) EPC). According to Rule 159(1)(c) EPC, the filing fee must be paid on entry into the European phase. Hence, for validly entering the European phase today, it is necessary to pay the filing fee. In view of arguments raised on appeal it appears that the statement 5.3 could be understood as referring to the concept of “entry” versus “early entry” into  the European phase with regard to 26 February 2018. This would additionally require the lifting of the processing ban before the 31-month time limit has expired by filing a request for early entry (cf. GL E-IX, 2.8 and OJ EPO 213, 156).

Claim analysis 2018/P/EN/12 Description of the Client's Patent Application [001] The present invention relates to jugs or filter carriers for mounting on jugs with replaceable filter cartridges for filtering water. [002] In such jugs or filter carriers the filtering capacity of the cartridges is subject to exhaustion, and therefore the cartridges must be replaced after a certain number of filtering cycles and/or after a predetermined period of activity of the cartridge. [003] Jugs or filter carriers provided with counting devices are known. Typically the counting devices are installed on the lid and are incremented manually when the jug is filled thereby indicating the number of filtering cycles. A drawback of this solution lies in the fact that the counting device requires an operation to be carried out manually by the user. Furthermore, the opening of a flap on the lid also involves manual operation. Thus, filling the jug requires the use of both hands, one to hold the jug and the other to open the flap and to increment the counter. [004] It would be desirable to provide a jug where the amount of water filtered and therefore the level of exhaustion of the filter could be determined accurately. It would be desirable if the jug were easy to manipulate when filling and also when incrementing the counter indicating the number of times water has been added to the jug. Brief description of the drawings: [005] Figures 1 and 2 are two schematic sectional views of a lid which can be fitted on a jug or a filtering means having a replaceable filter according to a first embodiment. [006] In Figures 1 and 2, reference 1 indicates a jug for filtering. The jug 1 has a replaceable filter cartridge and comprises a lid 3, in which an aperture 4 is provided for the introduction of the water to be filtered. Claim analysis 2018/P/EN/13 [007] On the lid 3, at the aperture 4, a blocking mechanism 5 is mounted so as to pivot on a hinge 6 between a first, closed position in which it closes the aperture 4, as shown in Figure 1, and a second, open position in which it extends into the jug, as shown in Figure 2. Although in these figures the blocking mechanism is shown to pivot in a clockwise direction towards the closed position, it would be clear to a skilled person that were the jug turned such that the handle 16 is on the left side of the figures the blocking mechanism would pivot in an anti-clockwise direction towards the closed position. [008] The blocking mechanism 5 is secured to the lid 3 by means of a hinge 6 and comprises, on opposite sides of the axis of the hinge 6, a flap 7 that moves towards the lid 3 to close the aperture 4, and an arm 8 inclined with respect to the flap 7, such that, in the second, open position of the blocking mechanism 5 the arm 8 is brought close to the lid 3. [009] The lid 3 comprises a biasing means associated with the blocking mechanism 5 to bias the blocking mechanism 5 towards the first, closed position. The biasing means allows the blocking mechanism 5 to pass into the jug into the second, open position under the action of the flow of water through the aperture 4. In this first embodiment shown in Figures 1 and 2, the biasing means comprises a helical spring 9. The opposing ends of the helical spring 9 are secured, respectively, to the arm 8 and to the lid 3. [010] A counter 11 on the lid 3 comprises a display means 15 for the count value, electrically connected to a detector 12. The detector 12 is a proximity detector, with a magnet 13, fixed on the opposite end of the flap 7 from the hinge 6, and a magnetic detector 14 fixed in a corresponding position on the lid 3. The magnet 13 and the magnetic detector 14 are close together when the blocking mechanism 5 is in the first, closed position. This provides a jug that can be filled and the counter incremented without the need to use both hands. Claim analysis 2018/P/EN/14 [011] As shown in Figure 2, the passage of the flow of water going into the jug 1 through the aperture 4 causes the pivoting of the blocking mechanism 5 from the first, closed position to the second, open position. [012] The interruption of the passage of the flow of water results in the return of the blocking mechanism 5 from the open position to the closed position by the action of the helical spring 9. The magnetic detector 14 detects a change in magnetic field resulting from the magnet 13 moving towards the magnetic detector 14. The magnetic detector 14 then actuates the counter 11, increasing (or decreasing) by one unit the number indicated by the display means 15. The invention thus provides an advantage of automatically counting the filtering cycles in order to determine the level of exhaustion of the cartridge by the action of the water introduced into the jug, rather than requiring manual intervention by the user. [013] In a second embodiment (not shown) the detector is of the type with electrical contacts instead of the magnet and magnetic detector such that the relevant circuit is closed when the contacts contact each other and is open when they are distanced from each other. The counter is incremented in response to detecting a change in electric current caused by the contacts contacting each other. [014] The third embodiment (not shown) provides an alternative detector comprising electrodes, which when immersed in a conductive liquid such as water, close a circuit which increments a counter. Thus, the counter is incremented in response to the water in the jug submerging the electrodes by reaching or exceeding a predetermined level. One problem with detectors that detect water level is that movement of the water, e.g. when the water is poured from the jug, may result in a false positive. Claim analysis 2018/P/EN/15 [015] Although the first, second and third embodiments relate to a lid on a jug, in an alternative embodiment the lid may be a lid on a filter carrier. In this alternative embodiment the filter carrier comprises the lid, a reservoir for holding water, a replaceable filter cartridge and an outlet through which filtered water is output. Claim analysis 2018/P/EN/16 Drawings of the client's application Fig. 1 Fig. 2 1 15 14 4 3 12 11 13 7 5 6 8 9 16 1 13 7 5 9 6 8 4 3 15 14 11 16 Claim analysis 2018/P/EN/17 Document D1 [001] A jug for filtering water is provided with a counting device, typically installed on the lid, to indicate the number of filtering cycles carried out since a filter cartridge within the jug was last replaced, in order to determine the level of exhaustion of the filter cartridge. The number indicated by the device is incremented each time the user opens the lid of the jug. [002] Figures 1 to 3 illustrate three examples of the jug according to three different embodiments. Each embodiment shows a jug 101 comprising a replaceable filter cartridge 102, a lid 103 and a counter 111. The configuration of the lid and counter is different for the three embodiments. [003] Figure 1 shows a first embodiment with a lid 103 with a flap 105 which is manually moved to open or block an aperture 104 in the lid. In this embodiment the flap 105 is slid to open or close the aperture. When in the open position flap 105 contacts an actuator/detector 116 associated with counter 111 causing the counter 111 to increment. In this way in order to fill the jug the flap 105 is manually moved from the closed to the open position revealing aperture 104 and resulting in the automatic incrementation of the counter 111. [004] Figure 2 shows a second embodiment where the flap 105 is manually pivoted away from the base of the jug to open aperture 104. The detector 116 detects the proximity of the flap 105 and transmits an incrementing signal to counter 111 in response to detecting the flap moving from the open to the closed position. Claim analysis 2018/P/EN/18 [005] Figure 3 shows a third embodiment where the counter 111 is manually incremented by a user pressing actuator/detector 116. Thus, a user can determine when the jug has been filled and increment the counter. In this way a record is kept of how many times the jug has been filled allowing a user to determine when it is time to replace the filter cartridge. Claim analysis 2018/P/EN/19 Drawings of D1 Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 103 116 104 102 101 111 103 105 103 104 102 101 111 105 116 105 103 104 102 101 111 116 Claim analysis 2018/P/EN/20 Document D2 [001] A water-purification jug having a filter cartridge that is subject to exhaustion is disclosed. A need has emerged to provide a system which can indicate to the user the moment at which it is necessary to replace the exhausted cartridge. [002] It is known, for example, to provide counting means associated with a removable lid of the jug, for counting the number of lid-opening and lid-closure cycles. This measurement clearly lacks reliability since it is in no way correlated with a direct measurement of the amount of water introduced into the jug. [003] An object of the invention is to provide a jug in which the amount of water treated by the filter cartridge is accurately determined. [004] Brief description of the drawings: Figure 1a is a schematic, side elevational and sectioned view of a lid on top of a filter jug formed in accordance with a first embodiment; Figure 1b shows the same embodiment as Figure 1a, with the aperture closed; Figure 2 is a view similar to Figures 1a and 1b of a lid on a filter jug formed in accordance with a second embodiment. [005] The jug 201 comprises a container 217 being closed by a removable lid 203. The lid 203 has a conduit 204 for the introduction of water to the jug 201. [006] Figures 1a and 1b show a first embodiment. The jug 201 comprises a detector 212 for measuring the flow of water introduced into the jug 201 through the conduit 204 and a counter 211 for counting signals received from the detector. [007] The detector 212 comprises a turbine wheel 213 comprising blades 213a extending radially across the cross-section of the conduit 204. Claim analysis 2018/P/EN/21 [008] A magnet on one or more blades 213a of the turbine wheel 213 is detected by a magnetic detector associated with the flexible guide 214. The counter 211 counts the number of times the one or more blades 213a of the turbine wheel 213 contact the flexible guide 214. [009] The blade closes the conduit each time that it contacts the flexible guide. Thus, the flexible guide and blade act as a blocking means for blocking the conduit. When the counter value indicates that the total amount of water introduced to the jug is such that the current filter cartridge is exhausted, use of the filter can be prevented by the rotation of the turbine wheel being stopped in a position where a blade is in contact with the flexible guide. This is shown in Figure 1b, while Figure 1a shows the conduit open. [010] Figure 2 schematically shows a second embodiment where there is no flexible guide and where the blades of the turbine wheel mechanically increment a counter 211 by connecting with an actuator/detector 216. In this case there is no way of blocking the entry of water when the filter cartridge is exhausted.

    "question": "Question 10 Hans filed an admissible notice of opposition against European patent EP-H. EP-H was validated in all EPC contracting states. EP-H validly claims priority from an earlier patent application. In the notice of opposition, Hans raised an objection of lack of inventive step of claim 1 over the combination of two prior art documents, D1 and D2. While the opposition proceedings are pending, Theresa files third-party observations, arguing that claim 1 lacks novelty over D3, a German patent application filed before the priority date of EP-H and published after that date. For each of the statements 10.1 – 10.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the statement is true or false: 10.1 Third parties are entitled to file observations during opposition proceedings. 10.2 If oral proceedings are to be held and the opposition division follows Theresa’s objections with regard to novelty, it will also summon Theresa to the oral proceedings. 10.3 If the European patent is maintained in amended form, it could contain different claims for different designated states. 10.4 If Hans does not file a copy of D1 within the opposition period, the opposition will be inadmissible. 2019/P/EN/11 Claims analysis Client’s application (with claims as originally filed) The present invention relates to a washing composition in the form of a tablet. The washing composition comprises: (a) One or more detergents (i.e. surface active agents), preferably in an amount of 10 to 30% of the weight of the tablet. (b) One or more builders, preferably in an amount of 20 to 60% of the weight of the tablet. Builders help to keep the water soft. Various builders and the properties described herein are known to the skilled person. Builders can be (i) phosphate- based (i.e. they comprise phosphate salts) or (ii) phosphate salt-free (e.g. polycarbonate-based, silicate-based and so on). Phosphate salt-free builders are preferred. (c) One or more bleaches, preferably in an amount of 10 to 30% of the weight of the tablet. Bleaches destroy coloured dirt components such as chocolate or red wine stains. (d) Optionally a colourant, preferably in an amount of 1 to 5% of the weight of the tablet. With regard to the tablet, preferably all detergents are contained in a first layer of the tablet and all bleaches are contained in a second layer of the tablet. We have now discovered that the pressure typically used to prepare the tablet by way of compression leads to the degradation of one or more bleaches, whenever the detergents and one or more bleaches are mixed together. The advantage of having all detergents and all bleaches in separate layers is to preserve the bleaches, both during compression and during storage. Preferably a third layer is placed between the first and the second layer. The third layer preferably comprises only a builder. 2019/P/EN/12 Claims analysis For questions 11 to 14, consider that the following claims are the ones originally filed: I.1 A tablet comprising one or more detergents, one or more builders, and one or more bleaches. I.2 A tablet according to claim I.1, wherein the tablet comprises a first layer and a second layer. I.3 A tablet according to claims I.1 or I.2, wherein the first layer comprises a detergent. I.4 A tablet according to any one of claims I.1 to I.3, wherein the second layer comprises a bleach. I.5 A tablet according to claim I.2, wherein all detergents are contained in the first layer of the tablet and all bleaches are contained in the second layer of the tablet. I.6 A tablet according to claim I.2, wherein the first layer and the second layer are separated by a third layer placed between the first and the second layer. I.7 A tablet according to claim I.2, wherein the tablet comprises a third layer. I.8 A tablet according to claim I.6, wherein the third layer comprises one or more builders. I.9 A tablet according to claim I.7, wherein the tablet consists of the first layer, the second layer and the third layer. 2019/P/EN/13 Claims analysis Document D1 D1 discloses tablets usable in washing machines and dishwashers. The tablets include, as usual, a detergent, a builder, and a bleach. In a first embodiment, all ingredients are mixed together and compressed to form a tablet. In a second embodiment, the tablet is rendered optically more attractive to the consumer. According to the second embodiment, all ingredients are mixed together and then the mixture is divided into two separate parts. To a first part of the blend, a colourant is added. The first part of the mixture forms the first layer of the tablet and the second part of the mixture (which does not comprise the colourant) forms the second layer of the tablet. Document D2 D2 discloses washing tablets comprising two or more layers. Bleaches, detergents, and colourants are usually produced by different manufacturers. It is suggested to produce a tablet comprising three layers: a first layer comprising a builder and a bleach, a second layer comprising a builder and a detergent and a third layer comprising a builder and a colourant. 2019/P/EN/14 Claims analysis",

It is irrelevant if the examining division did not raise an objection under Article 83 EPC. 6.3 If the missing essential technical information regarding embodiment X1 is present in the abstract, the essential technical information can be incorporated into EP-X as missing parts within one month from the date of filing. FALSE - The abstract is not part of the disclosure (Article 85 EPC) so including the essential technical information from the abstract would offend Article 123(2) EPC. 6.4 An objection from the examining division under Article 83 EPC can be overcome by restricting EP-X to embodiment X2. TRUE - If X2 is sufficiently disclosed, a patent may be granted based on X2 (Guidelines F-III, 5.1)."

    "question": "Question 10: Applicant B validly files an international application, PCT-B, in 2019 without claiming priority and elects the European Patent Office as competent International Searching Authority (ISA). The European Patent Office is of the opinion that PCT-B does not comply with the requirements of unity of invention and relates to four inventions: B1, B2, B3 and B4. In response to the invitation from the EPO as ISA to pay additional search fees for B2, B3 and B4, applicant A pays additional search fees for B2 and B3 under protest and the protest fee is duly paid. Four months later, applicant A receives the International Search Report. For each of the statements 10.1 –10.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the statement is true or false: 10.1 If the review body of the ISA finds that the protest was entirely justified, the additional search fees will be refunded but not the protest fee. 10.2 If PCT-B has validly entered the European phase without any amendments to the claims, the EPO will invite the applicant to pay a search fee for invention B4 within a period of two months. 10.3 In order to receive a refund of an additional search fee paid in the European phase, the applicant must pay the additional search fee under protest. 2021/P/EN/16 10.4 If applicant A files a divisional application, EP-B-DIV, for invention B2 at the EPO, after PCT-B validly entered the European phase, the search fee paid for EP-B-DIV shall be refunded at 100%. 2021/P/EN/17 Part 3 of Pre-examination 2021 Description of a European patent application (date of filing: 31 March 2019) Title: Glass compositions for use as a photochromic lens [01] The present invention relates to a glass composition for use as a photochromic lens. [02] Photochromic lenses are used in eye-glasses. Photochromic lenses change colour depending on the amount of light present. In low-light conditions, such as inside, a photochromic lens will be substantially colourless. In conditions with increased light levels, such as outside, the photochromic lens darkens. The change in colour is a result of components in the photochromic lens which react with ultraviolet (UV) light. [03] Photochromic lenses currently in use also change colour depending on the temperature of the surroundings. For example, in the cold, the colour change is enhanced and the photochromic lenses become much darker in colour. In warmer temperatures the colour change is less apparent, thus providing sub-optimal eye protection from harmful UV light. [04] The present invention relates to an improved glass composition for use as a photochromic lens. [05] The glass composition of the invention comprises silicon dioxide, component A, component M and component X. 2021/P/EN/18 [06] Component A is used to lower the melting temperature of the glass composition. Preferably, component A is present in the composition in a content of about 10% to about 30% by weight, for example 10% to 20% by weight. Most preferably, component A is present in the composition in a content of 16% by weight. [07] Preferably, component A is selected from the group consisting of sodium oxide, sodium carbonate and boron trioxide. Most preferably, component A is sodium oxide. [08] Component A reduces the melting temperature of silicon dioxide and reduces costs, but the resulting glass composition, which contains silicon dioxide and component A, is water-soluble and unstable which makes it unsuitable for use as a lens. [09] Component M reduces the water-solubility and improves the stability of the glass composition, but only if it is present in certain amounts, otherwise component M has detrimental effects. The content of component M must be about 5% to about 10% by weight of the glass composition. If the content of component M is less than 5% by weight of the glass composition, the glass composition is not stable enough for use. If the content is greater than 10% by weight of the glass composition, the glass composition solidifies at high temperatures which makes it unusable. [10] Preferably, component M is selected from the group consisting of lime, zinc oxide and alumina. [11] Component X provides the photochromic characteristics of the glass composition. Component X is a molecule which upon exposure to light, reacts reversibly with itself and absorbs UV light. Component X provides improved resistance to colour change as a 2021/P/EN/19 result of a change in temperature. Preferably, component X is selected from compound alpha, compound beta and compound gamma, which are all similarly effective at absorbing UV light. [12] Compound alpha, surprisingly, provides a photochromic lens that is the most resistant to colour changes as a result of a change in temperature. [13] Therefore, most preferably, component X is compound alpha. [14] Component X may be present in a content of 10% by weight of the composition. [15] The invention also provides a process for manufacturing a photochromic lens from the glass composition of the invention, which comprises the following steps: (i) mixing components A and M together in a first vessel to obtain a first mixture; (ii) heating silicon dioxide in a second vessel to a high temperature; (iii) adding the first mixture from step (i) to the second vessel from step (ii) to form a second mixture; (iv) adding component X to the second mixture; (v) forming a photochromic lens; and afterwards (vi) allowing the photochromic lens to cool to a low temperature. [16] Preferably, the silicon dioxide is heated to about 1500 °C, about 1600 °C, about 1700 °C or about 1800 °C. Most preferably, the silicon dioxide is heated to 1675 °C. 2021/P/EN/20 [17] The combination of steps in the above-mentioned process results in a photochromic lens which changes colour from colourless to red upon exposure to UV light. [18] The invention also provides a photochromic lens obtainable by the above-mentioned process. 2021/P/EN/21 The following claim set was filed with the application. CLAIM SET I I-1. A glass composition for use as a photochromic lens comprising: silicon dioxide; component A; component M; and component X. I-2. The composition according to claim I-1 wherein component A is present in the composition in a content of about 10% to about 30% by weight. I-3.

The composition according to claim I-1 wherein component M is present in the composition in a content of 5% to 10% by weight. I-5. The composition according to claim I-4 wherein component M is present in the composition in a content of 15% by weight. I-6. The composition according to any one of claims I-1 to I-5, wherein component X is selected from the group consisting of compound alpha, compound beta and compound gamma. I-7. The process according to any one of claims I-1 to I-6, wherein component M is selected from the group consisting of: lime, zinc oxide and alumina. 2021/P/EN/22 I-8. A process for manufacturing a photochromic lens from the glass composition according to any one of claims I-1 to I-7, which comprises the following steps: (i) mixing components A and M together in a first vessel to obtain a first mixture; (ii) heating silicon dioxide in a second vessel to an high temperature; (iii) adding the first mixture from step (i) to the second vessel from step (ii) to form a second mixture; (iv) adding component X to the second mixture; (v) forming a photochromic lens; and afterwards (vi) allowing the photochromic lens to cool to a low temperature. I-9. A photochromic lens obtainable by the process of claim I-8. 2021/P/EN/23 D1 – International application PCT-1 filed on 23 November 2016; published on 24 May 2018 [01] The present invention relates to a glass composition which is suitable for use as a glass bottle. [02] Glass bottles are used to store different types of liquids, for example corrosive liquids and liquids which are sensitive to light. The type of liquids, which are to be stored in the bottle affects the materials to be used to make the glass. [03] The main component in glass is sand, which consists primarily of silicon dioxide. Sand can be mixed with a number of other ingredients which affect the properties of glass as outlined in the table below: Stabilisers Additives UV light absorbers Component M Component B Component T Component N Component A Component U Component P Component C Component X [04] The stability of glass is improved by using stabilisers selected from the list of stabilisers in the table above. [05] Additives such as those listed in the table above may be used to provide or enhance certain properties. [06] In certain circumstances, it may be beneficial to include a UV light absorber. UV-light absorbers may be selected from those listed in the table above. [07] A preferred embodiment of the invention is a glass composition for use in a glass bottle comprising: 2021/P/EN/24 silicon dioxide; component P; component B; and component T. 2021/P/EN/25 D2 – International application PCT-2 filed on 23 January 2016; published on 26 July 2017 [01] The present invention relates to a glass composition for use as a photochromic lens in eye-glasses. [02] The glass composition of the present invention comprises: silicon dioxide; component A; component M; and component X; wherein component X is selected from the group consisting of compound beta and compound gamma. [03] The invention is further defined by the following examples. The percent values in the table below indicate the weight content of each component present in the composition: Example Silicon Dioxide Component A Component M Component X 1 69 16 5 10 2 44 30 6 20 3 38 25 7 30 2021/P/EN/26 D3 – European patent application EP-1 filed on 12 April 2018; published on 17 October 2019 [01] The present invention relates to the use of zinc oxide for blocking UV light. It has been found that zinc oxide is particularly effective at blocking UV light. It is present in a number of sunscreens. Zinc oxide may be used in glass compositions which are used in UV- blocking sunglasses for use where there is a high amount of UV light present. [02] The present invention provides a glass composition comprising silicon dioxide, component A, zinc oxide as component M and component X. Preferably, component X is compound alpha. [03] By using compound alpha, the colour change of the glass composition is more resistant to temperature changes compared to other glass compositions on the market currently used in sunglasses. 2021/P/EN/27",

    "question": "Question 10 A communication pursuant to Rule 71(3) EPC has been issued for a European patent application. The applicant has fulfilled all the necessary requirements. The related decision to grant a European patent has been despatched on the basis of the documents (Druckexemplar) transmitted to the applicant with the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC. The mention of the grant of the European patent has been published in the European Patent Bulletin. However, in the course of the preparation of the publication of the specification of this European patent an error arose, whereby page 2 of the description is missing in the published specification of this European patent. As a result of this error, the published specification of this European patent as a whole does not disclose the claimed invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art. For each of the statements 10.1–10.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the statement is true or false: 10.1 This error in the published specification of this European patent may be corrected at any time. 10.2 The European patent could be revoked on the basis of an opposition based on the ground of Art. 100(b) EPC because in the published specification of this European patent the invention without page 2 of the description is not disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art. 10.3 If the language of the grant proceedings for this European patent was English, a notice of opposition may be validly filed in German. 10.4 In order to request a transfer of the status of opponent to a different person during opposition proceedings, it is sufficient to file a declaration including the names, addresses and signatures of both the original opponent and the person wishing to take over the status of opponent. 2022/P/EN  Part 3 Description of a European patent application [001] It is generally known that yoga mats are used by athletes to perform yoga exer- cises. Yoga mats are thin, soft mats which are easily rolled and transported to allow the athlete to use them in various locations. Once rolled out on the floor, a yoga mat has a length of 1.5 to 2.2 metres and a width of 0.6 to 1.0 metres. Described herein is an im- proved yoga mat. [002] In an embodiment, we provide a yoga mat with a first colour on a first face and a different second colour on the second face. When the yoga mat is rolled out and in use, the first face is in contact with the floor and the second face is in contact with the athlete. This allows the athlete to always use the yoga mat such that the same face of the yoga mat is in contact with the floor. [003] In an embodiment, the first face of the yoga mat has a coating of material which provides secure but reversible adhesion of the yoga mat onto the floor. Preferably, the material is poly-X. The material covers 10 to 100% of the first face. [004] In an embodiment, the yoga mat contains antibacterial material, such as e.g. silver ions on the second face, so as to reduce the growth of bacteria. [005] In an embodiment, the second face contains a material which reduces the genera- tion of sweat on the athlete’s body. We have found that poly-Y is a highly suitable mate- rial, since it provides improved reduction of sweat generation on the body of the athlete while the athlete is in contact with the mat. Using our new special secret test protocol we established a sweat reduction value (SRV) of 100 for yoga mats made of poly-Y. Higher SRVs correspond to a higher level of sweat reduction. For yoga mats made of poly-X the SRV is 84, and for yoga mats made of poly-Z the SRV is 93. In an embodiment of the in- vention the yoga mat has an SRV of 90 or more. [006] In an embodiment, we provide the yoga mat with a very fashionable, fully organic textile container made from slow-growing cotton. 2022/P/EN  Claims filed together with the above European patent application: 1. Yoga mat having a first face and a second face. 2. Yoga mat according to claim 1, wherein the first face and the second face are dis- tinguishable. 3. Yoga mat according to claim 2, wherein the first face has a first colour and the second face has a second colour different from the first colour. 4. Yoga mat according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein, in use, the first face is in contact with the floor and the second face is in contact with the athlete. 5. Yoga mat according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the first face has a coating of material, said material providing secure but reversible adhesion of the mat onto the floor. 6. Yoga mat according to claim 5, wherein the material is poly-X. 7. Yoga mat according to any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the second face contains an antibacterial material. 8. Yoga mat according to any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the second face of the yoga mat contains silver ions. 9. Yoga mat according to claim 6, wherein the material covers 10 to 100% of the first face. 10. Yoga mat according to any of claims 1 to 9, wherein the second face contains a material, preferably poly-Y, wherein the material is such that upon contact with the athlete’s body it reduces the generation of sweat on the athlete’s body. 11. Textile bag for completely covering and for transporting yoga mats. 12. The textile bag of claim 11, containing the yoga mat according to any of claims 1 to 10. 13. The textile bag of claim 12, wherein the bag is made from fully organic material which grows relatively slowly. 14. Use of poly-Y in the production of yoga mats. 2022/P/EN  Assume in the following that documents D1, D2, D3, and D4 are prior art in accordance with Art. 54(1) and (2) EPC: D1: This document discloses a yoga mat. Before use, the athlete rolls out the yoga mat onto the floor. Then, the athlete steps on it to perform exercises. After use, the athlete rolls up the yoga mat and places it in a bag made from plastic or cot- ton, in order to transport it from one location to another. The yoga mat is very easy to transport, because it is made entirely of poly-Y, a very light, synthetic ma- terial. D2: This document discloses a yoga mat containing the material poly-Z on at least one face of the mat. Poly-Z has the following advantage: upon contact with the athlete’s body it reduces the generation of sweat on the athlete’s body. Advanta- geously, in a preferred embodiment, one face of the yoga mat is partially coated with a layer of poly-X. This material provides a strong adhesion of the yoga mat onto the floor while the athlete performs exercises. After use, the mat can be eas- ily removed from the floor. D3: Many athletes mark their yoga mats (e.g. by writing their names on one of the faces) to clearly distinguish the first face of the mat, which is in contact with the athlete, and the second face, which remains in contact with the floor. D4: Silver ions are used as antibacterial materials in many textiles (such as clothes, carpets) and on polymer material used for covering the floor of gymnastic halls. Antibacterial materials have the effect that they prevent or at least reduce the growth of bacteria. Such an effect is only to be found in very special metal materi- als such as silver ions or copper ions. 2022/P/EN",

True: Errors in publication occur where the content of the printed specification differs from the documents transmitted to the applicant with the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC, which form the basis of the decision to grant. Errors of this kind can be corrected at any time (Guidelines C-V,10 and H-VI,6). 10.2 The European patent could be revoked on the basis of an opposition based on the ground of Art. 100(b) EPC because in the published specification of this European patent the invention without page 2 of the description is not disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art. False: Mistakes in the specification of a European patent arising in the course of its production (such as printing of the B publication) have no effect on the patent granted (Guidelines C-V, 10 and H-VI,6). The decisive text is the text forming the basis of the decision of the grant. 10.3 If the language of the grant proceedings for this European patent was English, a notice of opposition may be validly filed in German. True: In written proceedings before the EPO, any party may use any official language (Rule 3(1) EPC, first sentence). 10.4 To transfer the status of opponent to a different person during opposition proceedings, it is sufficient to file a declaration including the names, addresses and signatures of both the original opponent and the person wishing to take over the status of opponent. False: Oppositions are not transferrable, but may be inherited or succeeded to as part of an overall succession in law (Guidelines D-I, 4, G4/88, G2/04) Part 3 Remark: There is a translation error in the German version [005] of the descrip- tion, second line. It should read Poly-Y and not Poly-X. Due to this translation error the Examination Board decided to award full marks to all candidates for questions 11 to 15."

    "question": "On 31 January 2022, Susanne, a German national living in Germany, filed a PCT application PCT-S in German, validly claiming priority from her European patent application EP-S, filed on 29 January 2021 in German. PCT-S contains claim 1 as originally disclosed in EP-S and claim 2 directed to an improved embodiment that was not disclosed in EP-S. PCT-S was published in German on 7 August 2022. Susanne sold PCT-S to Ian, a British national. The international search report issued by the EPO as International Searching Authority states that claim 1 is not novel over the prior art and the subject-matter of claim 2 is novel and involves an inventive step. Ian wants to enter the regional phase before the EPO for PCT-S. Today is 6 March 2023. For each of the statements, indicate whether the statement is true (T) or false (F): 5.1 When entering the regional phase before the EPO, Ian can file an English translation of PCT-S so that the language of the proceedings of the regional phase of PCT-S will be English. 5.2 The time limit for entering the regional phase before the EPO for PCT-S claiming priority from EP-S ends on 31 July 2023. 5.3 Today, 6 March 2023, Ian can withdraw the priority claim of PCT-S in the international phase so that the time limit for entering the regional phase before the EPO for PCT-S expires on 2 September 2024. 5.4 Withdrawing the priority claim of EP-S will affect the effective date of claim 2.",
    "answer": "5.1 FALSE: If an international patent application has been filed and published under the PCT in an official language of the EPO, it is not possible, on entry into the European phase, to file a translation of the application into another EPO official language (G 4/08). 5.2 FALSE: Calculating 31 months from priority date, the time limit for entering the regional phase before the EPO for PCT-S ends on 29 August 2023 (Rule 159(1) EPC). 5.3 TRUE: The priority claim of PCT-S can be withdrawn in the international phase until 29 January 2021 + 30 months (Rule 90bis.3 PCT) -> 29 July 2023 (Saturday) -> 31 July 2023. The time limit for entry into EP-phase becomes 31 January 2022 + 31 months (Rule 159(1) EPC) -> 31 August 2024 (Saturday) -> 2 September 2024. 5.4 FALSE: Claim 2 was not disclosed in EP-S, the priority is not valid for this claim, and the effective date of this claim is the filing date of PCT-S (Article 88(3) EPC)."
